# 100% RV32I Compliance Achievement

**Date**: 2025-10-11
**Achievement**: All 42 RV32I compliance tests now PASSING (100%)
**Previous Status**: 40/42 tests passing (95%)

## Summary

Successfully achieved 100% RV32I compliance by fixing the two remaining failing tests:
1. `rv32ui-p-fence_i` - FENCE.I instruction for self-modifying code
2. `rv32ui-p-ma_data` - Misaligned data access operations

## Changes Made

### 1. FENCE.I Instruction Support

**Problem**: FENCE.I test was failing because self-modifying code wasn't working. The test writes instructions to data memory, executes FENCE.I, then jumps to those instructions.

**Root Cause**: Our Harvard architecture has separate instruction and data memories that don't communicate. Stores to memory didn't update instruction memory.

**Solution**: Made instruction memory writable from the MEM stage.

**Files Modified**:
- `rtl/memory/instruction_memory.v`:
  - Added write interface (clk, mem_write, write_addr, write_data, funct3)
  - Added write logic that mirrors data memory write behavior
  - Supports SB, SH, SW, SD operations with misaligned access

- `rtl/core/rv32i_core_pipelined.v`:
  - Connected MEM stage signals to instruction memory write interface
  - Write address: `exmem_alu_result`
  - Write data: `exmem_mem_write_data`
  - Write enable: `exmem_mem_write && exmem_valid && !exception`

**Result**: âœ… rv32ui-p-fence_i now passes in 552 cycles

### 2. Misaligned Access Support

**Problem**: ma_data test was timing out / failing because misaligned load/store operations were triggering exceptions or not working correctly.

**Root Cause**: Two issues:
1. Exception unit was detecting and raising misaligned access exceptions
2. Data memory load/store logic was using aligned addresses (word_addr/dword_addr) instead of preserving the offset

**Solution**:

#### Part A: Disable Misaligned Access Exceptions

**Files Modified**:
- `rtl/core/exception_unit.v` (lines 85-110):
  - Set `mem_load_misaligned = 1'b0` (disabled)
  - Set `mem_store_misaligned = 1'b0` (disabled)
  - Added comment explaining that our hardware supports misaligned access natively
  - RISC-V spec allows implementations to support misaligned access in hardware

#### Part B: Fix Data Memory Misaligned Load/Store Logic

**Files Modified**:
- `rtl/memory/data_memory.v`:
  - **Loads** (lines 46-53): Changed from using `word_addr`/`dword_addr` to `masked_addr`
    - Before: `word_data = {mem[word_addr+3], mem[word_addr+2], ...}`
    - After: `word_data = {mem[masked_addr+3], mem[masked_addr+2], ...}`

  - **Stores** (lines 67-81): Changed from using `word_addr`/`dword_addr` to `masked_addr`
    - Before: `mem[word_addr] <= write_data[7:0]`
    - After: `mem[masked_addr] <= write_data[7:0]`

**Explanation**:
- `word_addr` = `{masked_addr[XLEN-1:2], 2'b00}` - forces word alignment (clears bottom 2 bits)
- `masked_addr` = `addr & (MEM_SIZE - 1)` - preserves offset, only masks to memory size
- For misaligned access at addr=0x8001 (offset=1), we need bytes at [1,2,3,4], not [0,1,2,3]

**Result**: âœ… rv32ui-p-ma_data now passes in 484 cycles

---

### 3. Compilation Script Fix

**Problem**: Compliance tests weren't compiling due to missing include paths.

**Files Modified**:
- `tools/run_compliance_pipelined.sh` (line 78):
  - Added `-I"$RTL_DIR"` flag to iverilog command
  - This allows the compiler to find `config/rv_config.vh` when included from RTL modules

---

## Test Results

### Before (95% compliance):
```
Total tests: 42
Passed: 40
Failed: 2

Failed tests:
  - rv32ui-p-fence_i (failed at test #5)
  - rv32ui-p-ma_data (timeout or error)

Pass rate: 95%
```

### After (100% compliance):
```
Total tests: 42
Passed: 42
Failed: 0

Pass rate: 100% âœ…
```

## Technical Details

### FENCE.I Instruction (Zifencei Extension)

FENCE.I ensures that subsequent instruction fetches see previous data stores. It's required for:
- Self-modifying code
- JIT compilation
- Dynamic code loading
- Cache coherence between instruction and data streams

Our implementation:
- Both instruction and data memories load from the same hex file
- Data stores now update instruction memory
- FENCE.I acts as an implicit synchronization (no explicit flush needed in our design)

### Misaligned Access

RISC-V allows three approaches:
1. **Hardware support** (our choice) - Accesses complete transparently
2. **Trap to software** - Exception handler emulates the access
3. **Fatal error** - Access causes unrecoverable error

Our implementation chooses hardware support because:
- Simplest for a unified memory system
- No performance penalty for compliance tests
- No exception handling overhead
- Common in modern processors

Misaligned access examples:
- `LW from 0x8001`: Reads bytes [01, 02, 03, 04] = word at offset 1
- `SW to 0x8002`: Writes 4 bytes starting at offset 2
- `LH from 0x8001`: Reads bytes [01, 02] = halfword at offset 1

## Files Changed Summary

1. **rtl/memory/instruction_memory.v** - Made writable for FENCE.I
2. **rtl/memory/data_memory.v** - Fixed misaligned load/store addressing
3. **rtl/core/rv32i_core_pipelined.v** - Connected MEM stage to I-memory writes
4. **rtl/core/exception_unit.v** - Disabled misaligned access exceptions
5. **tools/run_compliance_pipelined.sh** - Fixed include paths
6. **README.md** - Updated to reflect 100% compliance

## Impact

- **Compliance**: 95% â†’ 100% (perfect score)
- **Test Coverage**: 40/42 â†’ 42/42 tests passing
- **Functionality**: Added FENCE.I and misaligned access support
