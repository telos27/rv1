## Comparison with Phase 1

| Phase | Architecture | Passed | Failed | Pass Rate | Status |
|-------|--------------|--------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Phase 1 | Single-Cycle | 24/42 | 18/42 | 57% | Baseline |
| Phase 3 (Initial) | Pipelined | 19/42 | 23/42 | 45% | ‚ùå Regression |

## Bug Fixed This Session

### Control Hazard Bug (CRITICAL)

**Problem:**
- When a branch/jump was taken in the EX stage, only the IF/ID pipeline register was flushed
- The ID/EX register (containing the instruction after the branch) was NOT flushed
- This caused the "shadow" instruction to execute incorrectly

**Impact:**
- ALL 6 branch tests failed (beq, bne, blt, bge, bltu, bgeu)
- JALR (indirect jump) failed
- Pass rate dropped from 57% to 45%

**Solution:**
```verilog
// Before: Only flushed IF/ID
assign flush_ifid = ex_take_branch;

// After: Flush BOTH IF/ID and ID/EX
assign flush_ifid = ex_take_branch;
assign flush_idex = flush_idex_hazard | ex_take_branch;
```

**Result:**
- All 7 branch/jump tests now PASS
- Pass rate recovered to 57%

### ‚ùå Failed Tests (18)

#### Category 1: R-type Logical Operations (3 tests) - HIGH PRIORITY

| Test | Fails At | Status | Issue |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| rv32ui-p-and | Test #19 | ‚ùå FAILED | Data forwarding not working |
| rv32ui-p-or | Test #19 | ‚ùå FAILED | Data forwarding not working |
| rv32ui-p-xor | Test #19 | ‚ùå FAILED | Data forwarding not working |

**Root Cause**: The 3-level forwarding architecture exists but isn't eliminating RAW hazards. These tests fail at the SAME test numbers as Phase 1, indicating forwarding is not functioning.

**Expected Behavior**: With proper forwarding, back-to-back dependent AND/OR/XOR operations should work without stalls.

#### Category 2: Right Shift Operations (4 tests) - HIGH PRIORITY

| Test | Fails At | Status | Issue |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| rv32ui-p-sra | Test #27 | ‚ùå FAILED | Data forwarding not working |
| rv32ui-p-srai | Test #27 | ‚ùå FAILED | Data forwarding not working |
| rv32ui-p-srl | Test #53 | ‚ùå FAILED | Data forwarding not working |
| rv32ui-p-srli | Test #39 | ‚ùå FAILED | Data forwarding not working |

**Root Cause**: Same as R-type logical - data forwarding issue.

**Note**: Left shifts (SLL, SLLI) pass, but right shifts fail. This is the same pattern as Phase 1.

#### Category 3: Load Instructions (5 tests) - MEDIUM PRIORITY

| Test | Fails At | Status | Issue |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| rv32ui-p-lb | Test #5 | ‚ùå FAILED | Load-use hazard not detected |
| rv32ui-p-lbu | Test #5 | ‚ùå FAILED | Load-use hazard not detected |
| rv32ui-p-lh | Test #5 | ‚ùå FAILED | Load-use hazard not detected |
| rv32ui-p-lhu | Test #5 | ‚ùå FAILED | Load-use hazard not detected |
| rv32ui-p-lw | Test #5 | ‚ùå FAILED | Load-use hazard not detected |

**Root Cause**: Load-use hazard detection unit implemented but not working correctly. Tests fail very early (test #5), suggesting the stall/bubble mechanism isn't triggering.

**Expected Behavior**: When a load is followed by an instruction that uses the loaded data, a 1-cycle stall should be inserted.

#### Category 4: Store Instructions (3 tests) - MEDIUM PRIORITY

| Test | Fails At | Status | Issue |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| rv32ui-p-sb | Test #9 | ‚ùå FAILED | Unknown - needs investigation |
| rv32ui-p-sh | Test #9 | ‚ùå FAILED | Unknown - needs investigation |
| rv32ui-p-sw | Test #7 | ‚ùå FAILED | Unknown - needs investigation |

**Root Cause**: Unknown. Could be related to data forwarding or store data path timing.

**Note**: Store byte and halfword fail at same test (#9), while store word fails earlier (#7).

#### Category 5: Special Cases (3 tests) - LOW PRIORITY

| Test | Fails At | Status | Issue |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| rv32ui-p-fence_i | Test #5 | ‚ùå FAILED | FENCE.I not implemented |
| rv32ui-p-ma_data | Test #3 | ‚ùå FAILED | Misaligned access not supported |
| rv32ui-p-ld_st | Test #53 | ‚ùå FAILED | Complex load/store interaction |

**Root Cause**: These are expected failures:
- `fence_i`: Instruction fence not implemented (requires I-cache flush)
- `ma_data`: Misaligned data access not supported
- `ld_st`: Complex test with many load/store patterns

## Conclusion

The pipelined core has had its control hazards fixed and now matches Phase 1 baseline performance (57%). However, the data forwarding and load-use hazard handling are not yet functional, despite being implemented. The next session will focus on debugging why these mechanisms aren't working and achieving the target 93%+ pass rate.

**Key Achievement**: Control hazard bug fixed - all branches and jumps now work correctly! üéâ

**Next Challenge**: Make the data forwarding actually eliminate RAW hazards! üöÄ
