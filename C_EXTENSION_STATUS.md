## Root Causes Analysis

### Primary Issues

1. **Immediate Bit Scrambling**
   - RISC-V C extension intentionally scrambles immediate bits for hardware efficiency
   - Current implementation has incorrect bit extraction for many formats
   - Each instruction format (CIW, CL, CS, CB, CJ, etc.) has unique scrambling

2. **Register Field Mapping**
   - Compressed register fields (3 bits) map to x8-x15
   - Current expansion: `{2'b01, rd_p}` appears correct
   - But many instructions show wrong register numbers
   - May be using wrong register fields from instruction

3. **Format-Specific Encoding**
   - Each quadrant and funct3 combination has specific encoding rules
   - Some fields reuse bit positions for different purposes
   - Need careful validation against spec for each instruction

---

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate Priority - Next Session

1. **Fix store immediate field splitting** (C.SW, C.SD, C.SWSP, C.SDSP)
   - Store format requires immediate split: imm[11:5] in upper bits, imm[4:0] in lower bits
   - Current code incorrectly places all bits in one field
   - Affects 4 failing tests

2. **Fix load/store immediate bit scrambling** (C.LW, C.ADDI4SPN)
   - Carefully map each bit from compressed encoding to final immediate
   - Create detailed bit-level diagrams for each format
   - Verify against RISC-V spec section 16.2

3. **Fix C.ADDI16SP immediate scrambling**
   - Current mapping produces 256 instead of 16
   - Bits appear to be in wrong order in final immediate

4. **Fix jump and branch immediates** (C.J, C.BEQZ, C.BNEZ)
   - C.J has complex 11-bit scrambled immediate
   - Branch instructions have bit 11 encoding error
   - Requires careful JAL/Branch format understanding

5. **Investigate C.MV test discrepancy**
   - Our implementation: ADD format (matches RISC-V spec)
   - Test expects: ADDI format
   - Need to verify which is correct

6. **Re-run unit tests**
   - Target: 100% pass rate on tb_rvc_decoder
   - Current: 68% (23/34 tests passing)

### Secondary Priority
4. **Create decoder correctness checklist**
   - One instruction type at a time
   - Compare with working RISC-V implementations (e.g., Rocket, BOOM)

5. **Integration testing**
   - Once unit tests pass, test with actual programs
   - Verify PC increment logic with mixed code
   - Check alignment handling

### Final Steps
6. **Update configuration system**
   - Add C extension flag to rv_config.vh
   - Allow enabling/disabling at compile time

7. **Documentation updates**
   - Update README with C extension status
   - Document any limitations or quirks
   - Add usage examples

## Known Limitations

1. **F/D Extension Compressed Instructions Not Implemented**
   - C.FLW, C.FSW, C.FLD, C.FSD require F/D extensions
   - Currently marked as illegal
   - Can be added in future if needed

2. **Illegal Instruction Detection**
   - Basic detection implemented
   - May need refinement for edge cases

3. **Performance**
   - Single-cycle decompression (no penalty)
   - PC increment happens after fetch (minimal critical path impact)

**Status**: Significant progress made. Improved from 41% to 68% test pass rate. Core architecture is sound, register fields fixed. Remaining issues are all immediate encoding related - need careful bit-level mapping to match RISC-V spec.

**Confidence**: High - issues are well understood and fixable. The decompression approach (in IF stage) is correct. Register field bugs resolved. Remaining work is systematic immediate field debugging.
