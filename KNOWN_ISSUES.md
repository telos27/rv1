## Performance Limitations

### 1. Conservative Atomic Instruction Forwarding (6% Overhead)

**Status**: 🟡 **DOCUMENTED - Optimization Opportunity**

**Component**: A Extension - Hazard Detection Unit

**Description**:
The atomic instruction forwarding implementation uses a conservative approach that stalls the entire atomic operation if any RAW (Read-After-Write) dependency exists. This prevents a one-cycle forwarding gap bug but introduces ~6% performance overhead.

**Technical Details**:
- **Problem**: When an atomic instruction completes (`atomic_done=1`), there's a one-cycle transition where dependent instructions could slip through without proper stalling
- **Current Fix**: Stall entire atomic execution if dependency exists (`idex_is_atomic && hazard`)
- **Performance**: rv32ua-p-lrsc test completes in 18,616 cycles (expected: 17,567, overhead: 1,049 cycles = 6%)

**Better Solution Available (Not Implemented)**:
Add single-cycle state tracking to detect only the transition cycle:
```verilog
// Would reduce overhead from 6% to ~0.3%
reg atomic_completing;
always @(posedge clk) begin
  atomic_completing <= atomic_done;
end
assign atomic_stall = (atomic_completing && hazard) || normal_atomic_stall;
```

**Why Not Implemented**:
- Requires adding `clk`/`reset_n` ports to `hazard_detection_unit.v`
- Current solution is simpler and correctness is more important than 6% performance
- 6% overhead is acceptable for atomic operations (not common in typical code)
- Documented in code for future optimization if needed

**Impact**:
- **Low** for non-atomic code (no overhead)
- **Low** for typical mixed code (atomics are infrequent)
- **Medium** for atomic-heavy workloads (e.g., lock-based synchronization)

**Workaround**: None needed - functionality is correct

**Files Involved**:
- `rtl/core/hazard_detection_unit.v` (lines 126-155)
- `docs/SESSION33_LR_SC_FIX_COMPLETE.md` (full analysis)

**Priority**: Low (optimization opportunity, not a bug)

**Future Work**: Implement cycle-accurate state tracking to reduce overhead to 0.3%

## Resolved Issues

### ✅ Mixed Compressed/Normal Instruction Addressing Issue (Bug #23)

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** (2025-10-21)

**Component**: C Extension integration with 32-bit instructions

**Description**:
The RVC (compressed instruction) detection logic was incorrectly checking bits [17:16] when PC[1]=1, causing 32-bit instructions at halfword boundaries to be misidentified as compressed.

**Root Cause**:
The instruction memory fetches 32 bits aligned to halfword boundaries. The instruction at PC always starts in the LOWER 16 bits [15:0] of the fetched word, regardless of PC alignment. The original logic incorrectly assumed that when PC[1]=1, the instruction would be in the upper 16 bits.

**Symptoms**:
- CPU would loop infinitely through first few instructions
- PC would increment by 2 instead of 4 for 32-bit instructions at halfword boundaries
- Spurious data from middle of 32-bit instructions would be executed
- Test programs with compressed instructions would timeout

**Resolution**:
Fixed `rtl/core/rv32i_core_pipelined.v` to:
- Always use `instruction_raw[15:0]` for compressed candidate
- Always check `instruction_raw[1:0]` for compression detection
- Removed dependency on PC[1] for selecting which half to check

**Files Fixed**:
- `rtl/core/rv32i_core_pipelined.v` (lines 525-552)

**Test Evidence**:
With compressed instructions disabled:
- Integer register updates working: x1=1, x2=2, x3=-1 ✓
- FPU conversions partially working: a1=0x3f800000 (1.0) ✓, a2=0x40000000 (2.0) ✓

**Related Documentation**:
- Commit: Bug #23 Fixed: RVC Compressed Instruction Detection Logic Error

**Impact**: High - Blocked all mixed compressed/normal instruction programs
**Priority**: Critical (now resolved)

### 3. FPU Converter Blocking Assignments

**Status**: 🟡 **DOCUMENTED - Low Priority**

**Component**: Floating-Point Unit (FPU)

**Description**:
The `fp_converter.v` module uses blocking assignments (`=`) in sequential logic blocks, which can cause synthesis issues and simulation mismatches.

**Evidence**:
Verilator warnings:
```
Warning-BLKSEQ: rtl/core/fp_converter.v:136:23:
  Blocking assignment '=' in sequential logic process
  Suggest using delayed assignment '<='
```

Approximately 20-30 instances throughout `fp_converter.v`.

**Root Cause**:
Mixed coding style - combinational logic embedded in sequential blocks.

**Impact**:
- **Low** for current simulation (Icarus Verilog tolerates it)
- **Medium** for synthesis (may cause timing issues)
- **High** for formal verification tools

**Workaround**: None currently needed for simulation

**Fix Required**:
Separate combinational and sequential logic:
```verilog
// Current (problematic):
always @(posedge clk) begin
  sign_fp = fp_operand[FLEN-1];  // Blocking in sequential
  if (reset_n) begin
    result <= computed_value;
  end
end

// Fixed:
always @(*) begin  // Combinational block
  sign_fp = fp_operand[FLEN-1];
end

always @(posedge clk) begin  // Sequential block
  if (reset_n) begin
    result <= computed_value;
  end
end
```

**Files Involved**:
- `rtl/core/fp_converter.v`

**Priority**: Low (works in simulation, fix before FPGA deployment)

### 4. FPU Width Mismatch Warnings

**Status**: 🟡 **DOCUMENTED - Low Priority**

**Component**: Floating-Point Unit (FPU)

**Description**:
Multiple width mismatch warnings in FPU modules where signal widths don't match exactly.

**Evidence**:
```
Warning-WIDTHEXPAND: rtl/core/fp_minmax.v:56:48:
  Operator COND expects 64 bits on the Conditional True,
  but Conditional True's CONST '32'h7fc00000' generates 32 bits.

Warning-WIDTHTRUNC: rtl/core/fp_converter.v:150:41:
  Operator ASSIGNDLY expects 32 bits on the Assign RHS,
  but Assign RHS's COND generates 64 bits.
```

**Root Cause**:
FPU modules designed to support both 32-bit (single) and 64-bit (double) precision, but conditional expressions don't properly handle width differences.

**Impact**:
- **Low** - Automatic width extension/truncation works correctly
- May cause confusion in simulation waveforms
- Clutters synthesis reports

**Workaround**: None needed

**Fix Required**:
Add explicit width casting:
```verilog
// Current:
wire [FLEN-1:0] canonical_nan = (FLEN == 32) ? 32'h7FC00000 : 64'h7FF8000000000000;

// Fixed:
wire [FLEN-1:0] canonical_nan = (FLEN == 32) ?
                                 {{(FLEN-32){1'b0}}, 32'h7FC00000} :
                                 64'h7FF8000000000000;
```

**Files Involved**:
- `rtl/core/fp_minmax.v`
- `rtl/core/fp_converter.v`

**Priority**: Low

### 5. Missing CSR/Decoder Ports (Legacy Warnings)

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED - Legacy Warnings Only**

**Component**: Core Pipeline Integration

**Description**:
Some Verilator warnings may appear about missing CSR ports, but these are legacy warnings from earlier development phases.

**Current Status**:
- ✅ All CSRs fully implemented (M-mode + S-mode + delegation)
- ✅ Privilege modes working (M/S/U modes)
- ✅ Virtual memory connected (SATP, MMU, TLB)
- ✅ All necessary ports wired in pipeline

**Impact**: None - warnings are cosmetic

**Priority**: Low (warnings only, no functional impact)

---

## Resolved Issues

### ✅ Icarus Verilog Simulation Hang with Compressed Instructions

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** (2025-10-12, Root cause fixed 2025-10-21)

**Description**: Simulation would hang after first clock cycle when compressed instructions were present.

**Initial Resolution**: Issue appeared resolved through FPU state machine fixes.

**Actual Root Cause**: Bug #23 - RVC compressed instruction detection logic error (see above). The simulation wasn't actually hanging; it was looping infinitely due to incorrect PC increments.

**Evidence**: test_rvc_minimal passes with correct execution after Bug #23 fix.

---

### ✅ FPU State Machine Mixed Assignments

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** (2025-10-12)

**Description**: Five FPU modules had mixed blocking/non-blocking assignments for state machine logic.

**Resolution**: Fixed 70 lines across 5 files:
- `rtl/core/fp_adder.v` (18 lines)
- `rtl/core/fp_multiplier.v` (12 lines)
- `rtl/core/fp_divider.v` (16 lines)
- `rtl/core/fp_sqrt.v` (8 lines)
- `rtl/core/fp_fma.v` (16 lines)

**Fix**: Separated combinational (blocking) and sequential (non-blocking) assignments.

---

### ✅ Test Ebreak Exception Loop

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** (2025-10-12)

**Description**: Tests appeared to fail because ebreak caused exception loop, overwriting correct results.

**Resolution**: Implemented cycle-based test termination that checks results before exception loop.

**Evidence**: test_rvc_minimal now passes cleanly.

---

## Limitations

### 1. Test Programs Require Careful Cycle Counting

**Type**: Limitation

**Description**: Integration tests use cycle counting to terminate before exceptions. If pipeline timing changes, cycle counts must be updated.

**Workaround**:
- Document expected cycle count in test comments
- Use generous cycle counts (e.g., +20 cycles beyond expected)
- Can add dynamic detection of target register writes

**Future Improvement**: Implement proper trap handlers in test programs

---

### 2. No Exception Handlers in Test Programs

**Type**: Limitation

**Description**: Test programs don't have proper exception/trap handlers, so ebreak causes jump to address 0.

**Impact**:
- Tests must terminate before ebreak executes
- Cannot test exception handling itself
- Programs loop after ebreak

**Workaround**: Cycle-based termination in testbenches

**Future Improvement**:
- Add minimal trap handler stubs
- Set up mtvec CSR properly
- Implement proper ebreak handling

---

### 3. FPU Conversion Testing Incomplete

**Type**: Limitation

**Description**: FPU conversion instructions have critical bugs and very limited test coverage. We are at the **beginning** of FPU conversion testing, not near completion.

**Status**:
- ✅ FPU infrastructure implemented (52 instructions)
- ✅ Basic conversions for 1, 2 working
- ✗ Conversion of -1 produces wrong result (exp=0xBF instead of 0x7F)
- ⚠️ Conversion of 0 appears correct but needs verification
- ❌ ~90% of conversion test cases not yet run
- ❌ Official RISC-V F/D compliance tests not yet run

**Current Test Coverage**: ~10-20%
- 4 test values: 0, 1, 2, -1
- 1 direction: INT32 → FLOAT32
- 0 rounding modes tested
- 0 unsigned conversions tested
- 0 float→int conversions tested

**Known Bugs**:
- FCVT.S.W of -1 produces 0xDF800000 instead of 0xBF800000
- Exponent calculation error (+64 bias error)

**Remaining Work**:
- Fix -1 conversion bug
- Test FCVT.S.W comprehensively (100+ cases)
- Test FCVT.S.WU (unsigned variants)
- Test FCVT.W.S and FCVT.WU.S (float→int)
- Test all 5 rounding modes
- Test special values (NaN, Inf, denormals)
- Run official compliance tests (rv32uf-p-fcvt, rv32uf-p-fcvt_w)

**Detailed Status**: See [docs/FPU_CONVERSION_STATUS.md](docs/FPU_CONVERSION_STATUS.md)

**Priority**: High - Core functionality broken
