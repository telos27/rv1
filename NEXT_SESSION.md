## Immediate Tasks (Priority Order)

### 1. ✅ Fix Load/Store Issue - COMPLETED

**Problem**: load_store.s test showed X (unknown) values in registers after load operations

**Root Cause**: Address out-of-bounds error (NOT timing issue)
- Test used address 0x1000 (4096) which is beyond 4KB data memory (0x000-0xFFF)
- Accessing invalid address returns X in Verilog simulation

**Fix Applied**:
- Changed test program to use address 0x400 (1024, middle of valid range)
- Changed from `lui x5, 0x1` to `addi x5, x0, 0x400`

**Results**:
- ✅ x10 = 42 (word load/store)
- ✅ x11 = 100 (halfword load/store with sign extension)
- ✅ x12 = -1 (0xFFFFFFFF, byte load/store with sign extension)

**Documentation**: See `docs/BUG_FIX_LOAD_STORE.md` for detailed analysis

---

### 2. ✅ Expand Test Coverage - COMPLETED (2025-10-09)

**Created and verified 4 new comprehensive test programs:**

✅ **logic_ops.s** - Logical operations (12 tests)
- Tests: AND, OR, XOR, ANDI, ORI, XORI
- Result: PASSED (61 cycles, x10=0xdeadb7ff)

✅ **shift_ops.s** - Shift operations (10 tests)
- Tests: SLL, SRL, SRA, SLLI, SRLI, SRAI
- Edge cases: arithmetic vs logical shifts, sign extension
- Result: PASSED (56 cycles, x10=0xa0ffe7ee)

✅ **branch_test.s** - All 6 branch types (16 tests)
- Tests: BEQ, BNE, BLT, BGE, BLTU, BGEU
- Edge cases: signed vs unsigned comparisons, negative numbers
- Result: PASSED (70 cycles, x10=0xb4a4c4e3)

✅ **jump_test.s** - Jumps and upper immediates (11 tests)
- Tests: JAL, JALR, LUI, AUIPC
- Edge cases: function calls, return addresses, PC-relative addressing
- Result: PASSED (49 cycles, x10=0x00000050)

**Coverage improvement**: 40% → 85%+ (from 19/47 to ~40/47 instructions)

---

### 3. ✅ RISC-V Compliance Testing - COMPLETED

**Status**: All 42 RV32UI tests executed successfully

**Results Summary**:
- **PASSED**: 24 tests (57%)
- **FAILED**: 18 tests (43%)
- **Target**: 90%+ (not yet achieved)

**Key Findings**:
1. **Strengths** - Working well:
   - All branches (BEQ, BNE, BLT, BGE, BLTU, BGEU) ✓
   - All jumps (JAL, JALR) ✓
   - Basic arithmetic (ADD, SUB, ADDI) ✓
   - Comparisons (SLT variants) ✓
   - Left shifts (SLL, SLLI) ✓
   - Upper immediates (LUI, AUIPC) ✓

2. **Issues Found** - Failing tests:
   - Right shifts: SRA, SRAI, SRL, SRLI (4 failures)
   - R-type logical: AND, OR, XOR (3 failures)
   - Load/store: LB, LBU, LH, LHU, LW, SB, SH, SW, LD_ST (9 failures)
   - FENCE.I (1 failure - not implemented)
   - MA_DATA (1 failure - misaligned access, out of scope)

**Infrastructure Created**:
- Compliance test conversion scripts (tools/run_compliance.sh, tools/run_tests_simple.sh)
- Updated testbench with compliance test support
- Memory expanded to 16KB (for large tests)
- Address masking for 0x80000000 base addresses
- Comprehensive analysis report (COMPLIANCE_RESULTS.md)

**How to Run**:
```bash
# Convert and run all tests
./tools/run_tests_simple.sh

# Or manually run individual test:
iverilog -g2012 -DCOMPLIANCE_TEST -DMEM_FILE='"tests/riscv-compliance/rv32ui-p-add.hex"' \
  -o sim/test.vvp rtl/core/*.v rtl/memory/*.v tb/integration/tb_core.v
vvp sim/test.vvp
```

### 4. ⏳ Fix Right Shift Operations - NEXT PRIORITY

**Problem**: SRA, SRAI, SRL, SRLI tests fail (4 failures)
- Left shifts (SLL, SLLI) work correctly
- Indicates ALU shift logic bug for right shifts

**Action Items**:
1. Debug ALU shift right operations
2. Check sign extension for arithmetic right shift
3. Verify shift amount masking (should use lower 5 bits)
4. Test edge cases: shift by 0, shift by 31

**Files to Check**:
- `rtl/core/alu.v` - Shift logic implementation

**Expected Gain**: +4 tests → 67% pass rate

---

### 5. ⏳ Fix R-Type Logical Operations - PRIORITY 2

**Problem**: AND, OR, XOR tests fail (3 failures)
- Immediate versions (ANDI, ORI, XORI) pass
- Indicates register-to-register bypassing issue

**Action Items**:
1. Analyze AND test failure (failed at test #19)
2. Check if tests use back-to-back dependent instructions
3. Review single-cycle data path for bypassing needs
4. May need additional muxing for register reads

**Files to Check**:
- `rtl/core/rv32i_core.v` - Data path connections
- `rtl/core/alu.v` - ALU operations

**Expected Gain**: +3 tests → 74% pass rate

---

### 6. ⏳ Fix Load/Store Edge Cases - PRIORITY 3

**Problem**: All load/store tests fail (9 failures)
- Custom load_store.s test passes
- Compliance tests use more edge cases

**Action Items**:
1. Check sign extension for LB, LH
2. Verify zero extension for LBU, LHU
3. Test misaligned access handling
4. Check load-to-use data forwarding

**Files to Check**:
- `rtl/memory/data_memory.v` - Load/store logic
- `rtl/core/rv32i_core.v` - Memory interface

**Expected Gain**: +9 tests → 95% pass rate

---

### 7. ⏳ Performance Analysis

After all tests pass:

**Metrics to collect**:
- CPI for different instruction types
- Branch prediction accuracy (currently predict-not-taken)
- Critical path delay (estimate from waveforms)
- Resource utilization (after synthesis)

**Commands**:
```bash
# Synthesize with Yosys (if available)
yosys -p "read_verilog rtl/**/*.v; synth -top rv32i_core; stat"
```

## Phase 2 Preview

Once Phase 1 is complete, Phase 2 will implement:

**Multi-Cycle Architecture**:
- 5-state FSM (Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, Writeback)
- Shared instruction/data memory
- State-dependent control signals
- CPI > 1 (varies by instruction)
- Higher clock frequency (reduced critical path)

**Benefits**:
- Resource optimization (fewer functional units)
- Better understanding of processor design
- Foundation for pipelined implementation

See `PHASES.md` for detailed Phase 2 plan.
