# Session Notes: 2025-10-21 - FPU Debugging Continuation

## Session Objectives
Continue debugging rv32uf-p-fcvt test failures to implement complete FP conversion support.

## Starting State
- Bug #19 Fixed: FCVT direction bit handling
- Bug #20 Fixed: FP compare signed integer comparison
- Bug #21 Fixed: FP converter uninitialized intermediate variables for zero INT→FP
- rv32uf-p-fcvt test: 5/11 passing (45%)
- Test failing at test_5

## Work Completed

### Bug #22 Discovered and Fixed: FP-to-INT Forwarding Missing

**Problem**: FP instructions that write to integer registers (FMV.X.W, FCVT.W.S, FP compare) were not properly forwarded to subsequent integer instructions, causing data hazards.

**Symptoms**:
- Branch instruction after FMV.X.W saw stale register value (0x00000002 instead of 0x40000000)
- Test appeared to have "branch flush bug" but was actually a forwarding data hazard
- Only test_2 executed, tests 3-6 were skipped due to incorrect branch taken

**Root Cause**:
1. Forwarding unit didn't check `exmem_int_reg_write_fp` signal
2. `exmem_int_reg_write_fp` signal not connected to forwarding unit
3. Forward data mux used `exmem_alu_result` instead of `exmem_forward_data`
4. `exmem_forward_data` didn't select `exmem_int_result_fp` for FP-to-INT ops

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `exmem_int_reg_write_fp` input to forwarding_unit.v
- Updated all forwarding checks: `(exmem_reg_write | exmem_int_reg_write_fp)`
- Connected signal in rv32i_core_pipelined.v
- Updated `exmem_forward_data` to select `exmem_int_result_fp` when appropriate
- Changed `ex_alu_operand_a_forwarded` to use `exmem_forward_data`

**Files Modified**:
- `rtl/core/forwarding_unit.v`
- `rtl/core/rv32i_core_pipelined.v`

**Test Results**:
- **Before**: Failed at test_5 (only test_2 executed)
- **After**: Failed at test_7 (tests 2-6 now PASS!)
- Progress: From 1/6 tests passing to 5/6 tests passing in this section

## Current Test Status

### rv32uf-p-fcvt Test
- **Status**: Still failing (at test_7 now, was test_5)
- **Tests Passing**: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- **Tests Failing**: 7
- **Total Cycles**: 128 (was 112)
- **Progress**: 5 additional tests now pass with Bug #22 fix

### Next Test to Debug
Test 7 in rv32uf-p-fcvt - need to identify what this test does and why it fails.

## Debugging Methodology Used

1. **Systematic Investigation**:
   - Started with symptom (test fails at test_5)
   - Added PC trace to understand execution flow
   - Discovered branch was incorrectly taken
   - Traced branch operands to find forwarding issue

2. **Incremental Debug Output**:
   - Added FP operand trace
   - Added INT operand trace
   - Added branch operand trace
   - Added forwarding state trace (exmem/memwb registers)

3. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - Confirmed FMV.X.W writes correct value to register file
   - Found branch sees stale value despite correct writeback
   - Traced forwarding signals to find missing FP-to-INT support

## Debug Commands Reference

```bash
# Run single test with FPU debug
DEBUG_FPU=1 ./tools/run_hex_tests.sh rv32uf-p-fcvt

# Check test logs
cat sim/test_rv32uf-p-fcvt.log | grep -E "test number|FAILED|BRANCH|WB_FP2INT"

# Disassemble test binary
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d riscv-tests/isa/rv32uf-p-fcvt | less

# Rebuild with debug
iverilog -g2012 -o sim/official-compliance/rv32uf-p-fcvt.vvp -DDEBUG_FPU -DXLEN=32 \
  -Irtl -Irtl/core -Irtl/memory -Irtl/config \
  tb/integration/tb_core_pipelined.v \
  [... all RTL files ...]
```

## Key Insights

1. **Forwarding is critical for FP-INT interaction**: Every new write path needs explicit forwarding support
2. **Symptom ≠ Root Cause**: What looked like a branch flush bug was actually a data hazard
3. **Debug output is essential**: Comprehensive logging revealed the exact forwarding state
4. **Check all pipeline stages**: Fix required changes in both detection and data selection

## TODO for Next Session

1. **Immediate**:
   - [ ] Investigate test_7 failure in rv32uf-p-fcvt
   - [ ] Identify what test_7 tests (FCVT.L.S? different rounding mode?)
   - [ ] Debug and fix test_7 issue

2. **FPU Testing**:
   - [ ] Run full rv32uf test suite after test_7 fix
   - [ ] Test FCLASS instruction forwarding
   - [ ] Test FP compare instruction forwarding
   - [ ] Run compliance tests for F extension

3. **Documentation**:
   - [x] Document Bug #22 in detail
   - [ ] Update PHASES.md with current FPU status
   - [ ] Update test results tracking

## Files Changed This Session

### RTL Changes
- `rtl/core/forwarding_unit.v` - Added FP-to-INT forwarding support
- `rtl/core/rv32i_core_pipelined.v` - Connected signals, fixed forward data path

### Documentation
- `docs/BUG_22_FP_TO_INT_FORWARDING.md` - Comprehensive bug report
- `SESSION_NOTES.md` - This file

### Test Files (for debug)
- `tests/asm/test_fcvt_simple.s` - Simple FCVT test (not yet committed)
- `tests/asm/test_fcvt_simple.hex` - Generated hex (not yet committed)

## Quick Start for Next Session

```bash
# Current state
cd /home/lei/rv1

# Run failing test to see test_7
DEBUG_FPU=1 ./tools/run_hex_tests.sh rv32uf-p-fcvt

# Check what test_7 is
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d riscv-tests/isa/rv32uf-p-fcvt | grep -A 20 "test_7"

# Examine failure
cat sim/test_rv32uf-p-fcvt.log | tail -100
```

## Performance Metrics

- **Debugging Time**: ~1 session
- **Tests Fixed**: 5 additional tests passing
- **Lines of Code Changed**: ~20 lines across 2 files
- **Debug Output Added**: ~30 lines of debug code

## Notes

- Bug #22 was subtle - required tracing through multiple pipeline stages
- The fix is comprehensive and should work for all FP-to-INT instructions
- Need to verify with full test suite that we didn't break anything
- Test suite might have more edge cases to discover
