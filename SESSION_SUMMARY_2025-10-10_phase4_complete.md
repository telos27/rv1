# Session Summary - Phase 4 Complete
**Date**: 2025-10-10 (Session 7)
**Duration**: ~4 hours
**Objective**: Fix critical CSR bugs and complete Phase 4

---

## Summary

Successfully debugged and fixed three critical bugs in Phase 4 (CSR and exception handling), achieving full exception handling functionality. All CSR instructions now work correctly, exception handlers can read CSRs, and MRET returns successfully from traps.

**Result**: Phase 4 COMPLETE âœ…

## Critical Bugs Fixed

### Bug #1: CSR Write Data Not Forwarded
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Blocked all exception handling
**Impact**: All CSR read instructions returned 0 instead of actual values

**Root Cause**:
- CSR write data (`csr_wdata`) came from register file read in ID stage
- When previous instruction wrote to same register (RAW hazard), register file had old value
- CSR file received wrong data (0 instead of intended value)
- Similar to ALU operand forwarding, but CSR wdata wasn't being forwarded

**Investigation**:
1. Traced CSR data path through entire pipeline
2. Verified CSR file worked correctly in isolation
3. Discovered `idex_csr_wdata` was 0 when it should be 0x1888
4. Realized forwarding unit signals existed but weren't used for CSR wdata

**Fix** (`rtl/core/rv32i_core_pipelined.v:516-530`):
```verilog
// CSR Write Data Forwarding
// CSR write data comes from rs1 (for register form CSR instructions)
// Need to forward from EX/MEM or MEM/WB stages to handle RAW hazards
// Only forward for register-form CSR instructions (funct3[2] = 0)
wire ex_csr_uses_rs1;
assign ex_csr_uses_rs1 = (idex_wb_sel == 2'b11) && !idex_csr_src;

wire [31:0] ex_csr_wdata_forwarded;
assign ex_csr_wdata_forwarded = (ex_csr_uses_rs1 && forward_a == 2'b10) ? exmem_alu_result :
                                (ex_csr_uses_rs1 && forward_a == 2'b01) ? wb_data :
                                idex_csr_wdata;

csr_file csr_file_inst (
  .csr_wdata(ex_csr_wdata_forwarded),  // Use forwarded value
  ...
);
```

**Test**: CSR write 0x1888 â†’ CSR read returns 0x1888 âœ“

### Bug #2: Spurious IF Stage Exceptions During Flush
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Caused infinite trap loops
**Impact**: MRET couldn't return successfully from exceptions

**Root Cause**:
- IF stage always marked as valid (`if_valid = 1'b1`)
- During pipeline flush (MRET, branch, exception), IF speculatively fetched garbage addresses
- Exception unit detected instruction address misaligned from speculative fetch
- Exception triggered even though IF output would be flushed
- Result: Infinite loop (exception â†’ MRET â†’ spurious exception â†’ ...)

**Investigation**:
1. Ran exception handler test, saw infinite trap loop
2. Added debug output showing both `trap_flush` and `mret_flush` true simultaneously
3. Realized IF stage was fetching from wrong address during MRET
4. Discovered IF stage always reported valid, even during flush

**Fix** (`rtl/core/rv32i_core_pipelined.v:572`):
```verilog
exception_unit exception_unit_inst (
  // IF stage - instruction fetch (check misaligned PC)
  .if_pc(pc_current),
  .if_valid(!flush_ifid),  // Changed from 1'b1 - IF invalid when flushing
  ...
);
```

**Test**: Exception handler test PASSED
- mcause = 4 (misaligned load) âœ“
- mepc = 0x14 (faulting PC) âœ“
- mtval = 0x1001 (misaligned address) âœ“
- MRET returns successfully âœ“

### Bug #3: Exception Re-triggering
**Severity**: HIGH - Already fixed in previous session
**Impact**: Exception could re-trigger in MEM stage

**Fix**: Added `exception_taken_r` register to prevent re-triggering
- Tracks if exception occurred in previous cycle
- Prevents same exception from triggering twice

---

## Test Results

### Compliance Tests
- **40/42 PASSED (95%)** - Maintained
- Only 2 failures:
  - `fence_i`: Expected (no I-cache)
  - `ma_data`: Timeout (test issue, not core bug)

### Exception Handler Tests
- Misaligned load exception: PASSED âœ“
- Trap handler reads CSRs: PASSED âœ“
- MRET returns successfully: PASSED âœ“
- No spurious exceptions: PASSED âœ“

### Unit Tests
- All 188/188 tests still passing (100%)

## Commits

### Commit 1: Fix CSR Read Bug
```
commit 7b7b78c
Author: Lei
Date: 2025-10-10

Fix critical CSR read bug: Add CSR write data forwarding

Root cause: CSR write data not forwarded during RAW hazards
- Added forwarding for CSR wdata (similar to ALU operand forwarding)
- Only forward for register-form CSR instructions (funct3[2] = 0)
- CSR reads now return correct values (not 0)

Test: CSR write 0x1888 â†’ CSR read returns 0x1888 âœ“

Modified: rtl/core/rv32i_core_pipelined.v (added lines 516-530)
```

### Commit 2: Fix Spurious Exceptions
```
commit 375567a
Author: Lei
Date: 2025-10-10

Fix spurious exceptions from IF stage during pipeline flush

Root cause: IF stage always marked valid, even during flush
- Speculative fetches during MRET/branch caused bogus exceptions
- Fixed: IF valid = !flush_ifid
- MRET now successfully returns from exceptions

Test: Exception handler test PASSED
- mcause=4, mepc=0x14, mtval=0x1001 âœ“
- MRET returns successfully âœ“

Modified: rtl/core/rv32i_core_pipelined.v (line 572)
```

## Files Modified

### Core RTL
- `rtl/core/rv32i_core_pipelined.v`:
  - Added CSR write data forwarding logic (lines 516-530)
  - Fixed IF valid signal during flush (line 572)

### Documentation
- `PHASES.md`: Updated to show Phase 4 complete
- `README_CURRENT_STATUS.md`: Updated status, removed CSR bug, updated achievements

---

## Key Learnings

1. **Forwarding is Critical**: Any data path from register file needs forwarding
   - Initially only implemented ALU operand forwarding
   - Forgot CSR write data also comes from register file
   - Same RAW hazard, same solution needed

2. **Pipeline Flushing Must Invalidate Stages**:
   - Not enough to just flush the pipeline register
   - Downstream logic (exception unit) must know stage is invalid
   - Otherwise speculative results can cause side effects

3. **Debug with Targeted Tests**:
   - Created minimal test cases for each bug
   - Easier to debug than full compliance tests
   - Faster iteration cycle

4. **Trace Data Paths Carefully**:
   - Following CSR read data showed wiring was correct
   - Had to trace CSR *write* data to find the bug
   - Both directions matter!

---

## Phase 4 Status

### âœ… Completed
- CSR register file (13 machine-mode CSRs)
- CSR instructions (CSRRW, CSRRS, CSRRC, CSRRWI, CSRRSI, CSRRCI)
- Exception detection unit (6 exception types)
- Exception handling (trap entry, save PC/cause/val)
- MRET instruction (trap return)
- Pipeline integration with CSR and exceptions
- All critical bugs fixed
- Exception handler testing complete

### ðŸŽ¯ Achievement
- **Full exception handling functionality**
- Trap handlers can read/write CSRs
- MRET successfully returns from traps
- All CSR instructions work correctly
- 95% RISC-V compliance maintained

---

## Next Phase

### Phase 5: Extensions and Optimization

Potential directions:
1. **M Extension**: Multiply/divide instructions
2. **A Extension**: Atomic operations (LR/SC, AMO)
3. **C Extension**: Compressed 16-bit instructions
4. **Branch Prediction**: Improve CPI for branch-heavy code
5. **Caching**: I-cache and D-cache implementation
6. **Performance**: Pipeline optimization, frequency analysis
