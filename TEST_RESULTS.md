## Integration Test Results

### 1. Simple Add Test (simple_add.s)

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED**

**Program**:
```assembly
addi x10, x0, 5      # x10 = 5
addi x11, x0, 10     # x11 = 10
add  x12, x10, x11   # x12 = 5 + 10 = 15
mv   x10, x12        # x10 = 15
ebreak
```

**Expected**: x10 = 15
**Actual**: x10 = 15 ✓

**Cycles**: 5
**Instructions Tested**: ADDI, ADD, MV (ADDI alias), EBREAK

**Waveform**: `sim/waves/core.vcd`

---

### 2. Fibonacci Test (fibonacci.s)

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED**

**Program**: Computes the 10th Fibonacci number using iterative loop

**Expected**: x10 = fib(10) = 55
**Actual**: x10 = 55 ✓

**Cycles**: 65
**Instructions Tested**:
- ADDI (initialization)
- BEQ (base case checks)
- BGT (loop condition) - **bug fixed: changed from BGE**

- JAL (loop jump)
- EBREAK

**Performance**:
- Loop iterations: 9
- Average cycles per iteration: ~7.2
- Demonstrates correct branch prediction (not-taken strategy)

**Bug Fixed**: Loop condition was BGE instead of BGT, causing off-by-one error (computed fib(9)=34 instead of fib(10)=55)

**Waveform**: `sim/waves/core.vcd`

---

### 3. Load/Store Test (load_store.s)

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** (FIXED 2025-10-09)

**Program**: Tests word, halfword, and byte load/store operations

**Expected**: x10 = 42, x11 = 100, x12 = -1 (0xFFFFFFFF, sign-extended from 0xFF)
**Actual**: x10 = 42, x11 = 100, x12 = 0xFFFFFFFF ✓

**Cycles**: 11 (program completed)
**Instructions Tested**: ADDI, SW, LW, SH, LH, SB, LB, EBREAK

**Test Details**:
- Word operations (LW/SW): 32-bit values at word-aligned addresses ✓
- Halfword operations (LH/SH): 16-bit values with sign extension ✓
- Byte operations (LB/SB): 8-bit values with sign extension (0xFF → 0xFFFFFFFF) ✓

**Initial Issue** (RESOLVED):
- Original test used address 0x1000 (4096) which was out-of-bounds for 4KB data memory (0x000-0xFFF)
- **Root Cause**: Address range violation, NOT timing issue
- **Fix**: Changed base address from 0x1000 to 0x400 (1024, middle of valid range)
- **See**: docs/BUG_FIX_LOAD_STORE.md for detailed analysis

**Waveform**: `sim/waves/core.vcd`

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Priority: HIGH)

   - Fix: Changed test program to use address 0x400
   - All memory operations now verified and working

### Short-term

2. **Expand test coverage**
   - Create logic operations test (AND, OR, XOR)
   - Create shift operations test (SLL, SRL, SRA)
   - Create branch test (all 6 branch types)
   - Create jump test (JAL, JALR)

3. **Add complex programs**
   - bubblesort.s
   - factorial.s
   - gcd.s (greatest common divisor)

### Medium-term

4. **RISC-V Compliance Testing**
   - Clone riscv-tests repository
   - Run RV32I test suite
   - Debug and fix any failures
   - Target: 90%+ pass rate

5. **Performance Analysis**
   - CPI breakdown by instruction type
   - Critical path analysis
   - Synthesis with timing constraints

## Recommendations

1. ✅ **Fix load/store issue** - COMPLETED (was address bounds issue)
2. **Add more integration tests** - Currently ~40% instruction coverage
3. **Run compliance tests** - Industry-standard verification (ready now)
4. **Consider formal verification** - For critical paths (ALU, decoder)
5. **Document memory map** - Clarify address ranges for test writers
6. **Add address bounds checking** - Optional simulation warnings for out-of-bounds access
