# Bug #13 Fix Summary

## What We Fixed
**File**: `rtl/core/fp_converter.v`
**Lines**: 183-220

### Changes Made

1. **Line 185**: Improved `int_exp < 0` path
   - Changed from: `flag_nx <= (man_fp != 0)`
   - Changed to: `flag_nx <= !is_zero`
   - More explicit and correct

2. **Lines 214-220**: Fixed `int_exp >= 0` path ✅ **MAIN FIX**
   - **OLD (WRONG)**:
     ```verilog
     flag_nx <= (shifted_man[63:XLEN] != 0);
     ```
     This checked upper bits [63:32], which are the INTEGER part

   - **NEW (CORRECT)**:
     ```verilog
     if (int_exp < 63) begin
       flag_nx <= (shifted_man & ((64'h1 << (63 - int_exp)) - 1)) != 0;
     end else begin
       flag_nx <= 1'b0;
     end
     ```
     This checks fractional bits below the binary point

## Verification
- **Test case**: fcvt.w.s -1.1 (test #2 from rv32uf-p-fcvt_w)
- **Before fix**: flag_nx = 0 ❌
- **After fix**: flag_nx = 1 ✅
- **Proven by**: Debug logging showing correct flag value

## Current Situation
- Bug #13 fix is **CORRECT** and **VERIFIED**
- However, rv32uf-p-fcvt_w still fails at test #5
- RV32UF suite still 4/11 passing (no improvement yet)

## Why No Improvement Yet?
The test failures appear to be caused by ADDITIONAL issues beyond Bug #13:
1. Tests execute very quickly (80 instructions, 116 cycles)
2. Converter only called once (test #2)
3. Tests #3-5 may not be executing properly
4. Likely another bug in FFLAGS handling or test infrastructure

## Next Steps
Focus on ONE test: rv32uf-p-fcvt_w
- Understand why only 80 instructions execute
- Find where tests #3-5 are failing
- Don't assume it's a converter issue - may be CSR, FFLAGS, or test infrastructure

## Files Modified
- `rtl/core/fp_converter.v` - Bug #13 fix applied
- Added debug logging (can be removed later)

## Recommendation
Commit Bug #13 fix separately, then debug the FFLAGS/test issue as a separate bug.
