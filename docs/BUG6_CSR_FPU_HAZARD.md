# Bug #6: CSR-FPU Dependency Hazard

**Status**: ✅ FIXED - Pipeline bubble solution implemented
**Date Identified**: 2025-10-13
**Date Fixed**: 2025-10-14
**Impact**: Previously blocked RV32UF compliance progress
**Pass Rate After Fix**: 3/11 (27%) - Same as before, but now failing at correct test #11

---

## Problem Description

FSFLAGS/FCSR CSR instructions execute before pending FP operations complete, causing tests to read stale exception flags.

### Detailed Example

```
Cycle N:   Test 4 FADD starts (multi-cycle, will set inexact flag)
Cycle N+1: FADD in EX stage, fpu_busy=1
Cycle N+2: FADD still computing
Cycle N+3: Test 4 fsflags x11, x0 executes (reads/clears flags)
           - Reads fflags_r = 0x00000 (FADD hasn't completed yet)
           - Writes 0 to fflags_r
           - Returns 0 in x11
Cycle N+4: FADD completes, reaches WB stage
           - Sets fflags_we=1, fflags_in=0x00001
           - Accumulates: fflags_r = 0x00000 | 0x00001 = 0x00001
Cycle N+5: Test 5 starts with fflags_r = 0x00001 (accumulated from test 4)
           Test 5 fsflags reads 0x00001, expects 0x00000 → FAIL
```

### Root Cause

Pipeline hazard - no dependency tracking between:
1. CSR instructions that access FFLAGS/FRM/FCSR (in ID stage)
2. FP operations still in flight (in EX/MEM/WB stages)

---

## Fix Attempted

### Implementation

Added hazard detection in `hazard_detection_unit.v`:

```verilog
// Lines 192-194: CSR address definitions
localparam CSR_FFLAGS = 12'h001;
localparam CSR_FRM    = 12'h002;
localparam CSR_FCSR   = 12'h003;

// Lines 196-204: Detection logic
wire csr_accesses_fp_flags;
assign csr_accesses_fp_flags = (id_csr_addr == CSR_FFLAGS) ||
                                 (id_csr_addr == CSR_FRM) ||
                                 (id_csr_addr == CSR_FCSR);

// Lines 206-211: Stall logic
assign csr_fpu_dependency_stall = csr_accesses_fp_flags &&
                                   (fpu_busy || idex_fp_alu_en);

// Line 214: Added to stall signal
assign stall_pc = ... || csr_fpu_dependency_stall || ...;
```

## Results

### Positive Effects ✅
- Tests progress further: Fail at test #7 instead of test #11 (4 more tests conceptually passing)
- Faster execution: 188 cycles → 144 cycles (23% improvement)
- FDIV no longer times out (was timing out before)

### Critical Issue ❌
**Pipeline corruption**: Only 2 FP operations complete, then execution becomes erratic

**Symptoms**:
- Tests 2-3: Execute normally, produce correct results
- Tests 4-6: Data addresses never accessed (0x80002040, 0x80002050, 0x80002060 not seen in MMU log)
- Test 7: gp set to 7, but x10 still contains test 3's result (0xc49a4000)
- Test 7: FP operation never executes
- Final state: ECALL at cycle 144 with gp=7

**Comparison**:

| Metric | Without Stall | With Stall |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| Failing test | #11 | #7 |
| Total cycles | 188 | 144 |
| FP ops completed | 10 (tests 2-11) | 2 (tests 2-3) |
| Result | Wrong flags | Pipeline corruption |

## Analysis

### Why Pipeline Corruption Occurs

**Hypothesis 1**: Incomplete FP operation tracking
- Current check: `fpu_busy || idex_fp_alu_en`
- `fpu_busy`: Set by sub-units (adder, multiplier, divider, etc.)
- `idex_fp_alu_en`: FP instruction just entered EX stage
- **Missing**: FP operations that completed in EX but are still in MEM/WB stages
- For single-cycle FP ops, `fpu_busy` might go low before flags are written

**Hypothesis 2**: Interaction with other hazard logic
- Stall affects PC, IF/ID registers
- May conflict with M/A extension stalls, FP load-use hazards
- Could cause pipeline state machine to enter invalid state

**Hypothesis 3**: Timing of fpu_done signal
- `fpu_done` is 1-cycle pulse when operation completes
- Flags written in same cycle as `fpu_done=1`
- CSR instruction might proceed on next cycle before flags visible
- Fix attempts to not stall when `fpu_done=1`, but this is exactly when we SHOULD stall

**Hypothesis 4**: Hold signal interaction
- M/A/FP stalls use "hold" signals on IDEX and EXMEM registers
- CSR-FPU stall uses PC/IFID stall
- Different stall mechanisms might conflict

---

## Current Status

**Fix is DISABLED** (line 211 of hazard_detection_unit.v):
```verilog
assign csr_fpu_dependency_stall = 1'b0;  // Disabled for debugging
```

Without fix:
- Tests fail at test #11 due to original flag accumulation bug
- All FP operations execute properly
- Control flow is correct

With fix enabled:
- Tests progress further (fail at #7)
- Pipeline corruption prevents proper execution
- Only 2 operations complete

---

## Debugging Steps for Next Session

### 1. Waveform Analysis (CRITICAL)
Generate VCD waveforms and trace:
- PC values cycle-by-cycle (should progress 0x80000198 → 0x800002a0)
- Pipeline register valid bits
- `stall_pc`, `stall_ifid`, `bubble_idex` signals
- `fpu_busy`, `idex_fp_alu_en`, `fpu_done` timing
- `csr_fpu_dependency_stall` activation
- When stall triggers vs when FP operations complete

### 2. Add PC Trace Logging
Modify testbench to log PC every cycle:
```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
  $display("[%0d] PC=%08x stall=%b bubble=%b", cycle, pc, stall_pc, bubble_idex);
end
```

### 3. Check fpu_busy Signal
Verify `fpu_busy` correctly covers all FP operation states:
- During multi-cycle ops (FADD, FSUB, FMUL): Should be high
- During flag write (WB stage): Should it still be high?
- After operation complete: When exactly does it go low?

### 4. Test Simpler Case
Create minimal test:
```assembly
  fadd.s f1, f2, f3   # Multi-cycle operation
  fsflags a0, x0      # Should stall until fadd completes
```
Check if stall works correctly in isolation.

## Alternative Approaches

### Option A: Track "FP in flight" bit through entire pipeline
Add a bit that follows FP instructions through all stages:
- Set when FP instruction enters EX
- Remains set through MEM and WB stages
- Only clears after WB complete
- Stall CSR if any pipeline stage has FP bit set

**Pros**: Complete tracking of FP operations
**Cons**: Requires pipeline register modifications

### Option B: FP completion counter
Add counter tracking pending FP operations:
- Increment when FP operation starts
- Decrement when flags written to CSR
- Stall CSR if counter > 0

**Pros**: Simple, doesn't need per-stage tracking
**Cons**: May over-stall if operations complete out of order

### Option C: Delay flag accumulation to CSR write stage
Instead of accumulating flags in WB stage, buffer them and apply when CSR instruction reaches WB:
- FP operations set "pending_flags" register
- CSR instruction in WB stage triggers flag accumulation
- No hazard because both happen in same stage

**Pros**: Architecturally clean, no stalling
**Cons**: Requires significant CSR file changes

### Option D: Use existing pipeline valid bits
Check `idex_valid`, `exmem_valid`, `memwb_valid` along with FP operation indicators:
```verilog
wire fp_in_pipeline = (idex_fp_alu_en && idex_valid) ||
                       (exmem_fp_alu_en && exmem_valid) ||
                       (memwb_fp_alu_en && memwb_valid);
assign csr_fpu_dependency_stall = csr_accesses_fp_flags && fp_in_pipeline;
```

**Pros**: Uses existing infrastructure
**Cons**: Need to propagate `fp_alu_en` through all pipeline stages

---

## Final Solution (Implemented 2025-10-14)

After detailed waveform analysis and PC trace comparison, the root cause was identified:

### Root Cause
The CSR-FPU stall used `stall_pc` and `stall_ifid` to prevent new instructions from entering the pipeline. However, it did NOT prevent the CSR instruction in ID stage from advancing to EX stage when the stall released. This caused the CSR instruction to **execute twice**:

1. Cycle 103: CSR at 0x800001bc stays in ID (stalled)
2. Cycle 104: CSR advances to EX and executes
3. The instruction appears in both ID and EX simultaneously

### The Fix
Changed CSR-FPU stall to use **pipeline bubble** instead of just stalling:

```verilog
// rtl/core/hazard_detection_unit.v:222
assign bubble_idex = load_use_hazard || fp_load_use_hazard ||
                      atomic_forward_hazard || csr_fpu_dependency_stall;
```

This inserts a NOP into the EX stage while holding the CSR instruction in ID, similar to load-use hazards.

### Results
**Before fix**:
- Test failed at test #7 (gp=7)
- Only 2 FP operations completed
- Pipeline corruption caused early branch to failure handler
- 144 cycles total

**After fix**:
- Test fails at test #11 (gp=11) - the CORRECT failure point
- All 10 FP operations complete successfully
- No pipeline corruption
- 192 cycles total (vs 188 without any stall - acceptable overhead)

### Impact
✅ CSR-FPU hazard properly resolved
✅ Pipeline integrity maintained
✅ Tests now fail at correct locations (due to original flag accumulation bug #5, not hazard issues)
✅ Ready for next phase of FPU debugging

## Recommended Approach

~~**Priority 1**: Waveform analysis to understand exact failure mode~~ ✅ COMPLETED
~~**Priority 2**: Try Option D (pipeline valid bits) - simplest refinement~~ ❌ NOT NEEDED
~~**Priority 3**: If Option D fails, implement Option A (full tracking)~~ ❌ NOT NEEDED

**Actual solution**: Use bubble_idex (similar to load-use hazards) ✅ IMPLEMENTED
