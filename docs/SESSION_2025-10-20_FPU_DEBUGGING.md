## Bugs Fixed This Session

### Bug #10: FP Adder Special Case Flag Contamination ✅

**Severity**: CRITICAL
**File**: `rtl/core/fp_adder.v`

**Problem**:
- Special value operations (`Inf - Inf`, NaN, Zero) were setting correct results
- BUT the ROUND stage unconditionally overwrote exception flags
- Line 398: `flag_nx <= guard || round || sticky;` executed regardless of special cases
- This contaminated flags: `Inf - Inf` should set only NV but also set NX

**Solution**:
- Added `special_case_handled` flag to track when special cases are processed
- Set in ALIGN stage when any of 7 special cases detected
- ROUND stage now skips flag/result updates if `special_case_handled == 1`
- Explicitly clear all flags in special case branches

**Impact**:
- **rv32uf-p-fadd** test now **PASSING** ✅ (was failing at test #23)
- RV32UF: 3/11 → 4/11 (+9% improvement)

**Documentation**: `docs/FPU_BUG10_SPECIAL_CASE_FLAGS.md`

### Bug #11: FP Divider Timeout - Uninitialized Counter ✅

**Severity**: CRITICAL
**File**: `rtl/core/fp_divider.v`

**Problem**:
- `div_counter` not initialized before entering DIVIDE state
- Special case check at line 159: `if (div_counter == DIV_CYCLES)` failed
- Divider executed garbage iterations with uninitialized registers
- Tests timed out after 49,999 cycles (vs expected ~150 cycles)
- CPI: 617 (catastrophic!)
- 99.8% of cycles were pipeline flushes

**Solution**:
- Initialize `div_counter = DIV_CYCLES` in UNPACK stage (line 147)
- Also applied `special_case_handled` pattern from Bug #10
- Explicitly clear all flags in special case branches

**Impact**:
- Timeout **eliminated**: 49,999 → 146 cycles (**342x faster!**)
- CPI: 617 → 1.304 (healthy)
- Flush cycles: 99.8% → 8.2% (normal)
- rv32uf-p-fdiv no longer times out (still fails at test #5, accuracy issue)

**Documentation**: `docs/FPU_BUG11_FDIV_TIMEOUT.md`

---

### Bug #12: FP Multiplier Special Case Flag Contamination ✅

**Severity**: MEDIUM
**File**: `rtl/core/fp_multiplier.v`

**Problem**:
- Same pattern as Bug #10
- ROUND stage (line 270) unconditionally set `flag_nx`
- Special cases in MULTIPLY stage jumped to DONE but flags got overwritten

**Solution**:
- Applied same `special_case_handled` pattern as adder and divider
- Added flag in UNPACK, set in special cases, check in ROUND
- Explicitly clear all flags in 4 special case branches (NaN, 0×Inf, Inf×x, 0×x)

**Impact**:
- No immediate test improvement (remaining tests don't hit multiplier special cases)
- Prevents future bugs and ensures consistency across FP modules

## Test Results

### Before Session
- **RV32UF**: 3/11 passing (27%)
  - ✅ PASSING: fclass, ldst, move
  - ❌ FAILING: **fadd** (test #23), fcmp, fcvt, fcvt_w, fmin, fmadd, recoding
  - ⏱️ **TIMEOUT**: **fdiv** (49,999 cycles)

### After Session
- **RV32UF**: 4/11 passing (36%)
  - ✅ **PASSING**: **fadd** (NEW!), fclass, ldst, move
  - ❌ FAILING: fcmp, fcvt, fcvt_w, **fdiv** (no timeout!), fmadd, fmin, recoding

### Key Achievements
1. ✅ **fadd test passing** - Complete special case handling working
2. ✅ **fdiv timeout eliminated** - 342x performance improvement
3. ✅ **Systematic fix pattern established** - Can be applied to other FP modules

## Technical Insights

### The `special_case_handled` Pattern

This pattern emerged as the solution to flag contamination in sequential FP modules:

```verilog
// 1. Add tracking flag
reg special_case_handled;

// 2. Initialize in reset
if (!reset_n) begin
  special_case_handled <= 1'b0;
end

// 3. Clear in UNPACK stage
UNPACK: begin
  special_case_handled <= 1'b0;
  // ... unpacking logic ...
end

// 4. Set in special case branches
if (is_nan_a || is_nan_b) begin
  result <= canonical_nan;
  flag_nv <= 1'b1;
  flag_nx <= 1'b0;  // Explicitly clear
  flag_of <= 1'b0;
  flag_uf <= 1'b0;
  special_case_handled <= 1'b1;  // Mark as handled
  state <= DONE;
end

// 5. Skip normal processing in ROUND
ROUND: begin
  if (!special_case_handled) begin
    // Normal rounding and flag setting
    flag_nx <= guard || round || sticky;
  end
  // else: special case already set flags
end
```

**Why this works**:
- Special cases set flags early and bypass normal computation
- But state machine still progresses through all states (COMPUTE → NORMALIZE → ROUND)
- ROUND stage would unconditionally set flags based on GRS bits
- The flag prevents ROUND from overwriting special case flags

**Modules fixed with this pattern**:
- ✅ `fp_adder.v` (Bug #10)
- ✅ `fp_divider.v` (Bug #11)
- ✅ `fp_multiplier.v` (Bug #12)

**Modules that may need it**:
- ⚠️ `fp_fma.v` (fused multiply-add)
- ⚠️ `fp_converter.v` (format conversion)
- ⚠️ `fp_sqrt.v` (square root)

## Remaining FPU Issues

### Failing Tests Analysis

**fcmp** (comparison) - Failing at test #13
- Combinational module, no flag contamination issue
- Likely edge case in NaN handling or comparison logic

**fmin** (min/max) - Failing at test #15
- Combinational module, no flag contamination issue
- Likely NaN propagation or ±0 handling edge case

**fdiv** (division) - Failing at test #5
- Timeout fixed, but division algorithm has accuracy bugs
- May be normalization, rounding, or GRS bit calculation errors

**fcvt, fcvt_w** (conversion) - Unknown failure points
- Format conversion edge cases
- Likely subnormal, overflow, or rounding issues

**fmadd** (fused multiply-add) - Unknown failure point
- Most complex FP operation (3 operations in pipeline)
- May have unique flag accumulation or rounding issues

**recoding** (NaN-boxing) - Unknown failure point
- Likely pipeline integration or NaN-boxing verification issue

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Unconditional Assignments Are Dangerous

Lines like `flag_nx <= guard || round || sticky;` should **always** be conditional on operation type:
```verilog
// BAD
flag_nx <= guard || round || sticky;

// GOOD
if (!special_case_handled) begin
  flag_nx <= guard || round || sticky;
end
```

### 2. State Machine Initialization Matters

All loop counters and control variables must be initialized in the state **immediately before** they're used:
```verilog
// BAD: Counter initialized in DONE, undefined in first DIVIDE entry
DONE: div_counter <= DIV_CYCLES;

// GOOD: Counter initialized in UNPACK, ready for DIVIDE
UNPACK: div_counter <= DIV_CYCLES;
```

### 3. Test Metrics Reveal Root Causes

The fdiv timeout metrics were diagnostic:
- CPI of 617 → stuck in loop
- 99.8% flush cycles → something blocking pipeline
- PC becomes X → divider never completing

These immediately pointed to the divider state machine as the culprit.

### 4. Systematic Patterns Scale

Once the `special_case_handled` pattern was established for the adder (Bug #10), it could be quickly applied to divider (Bug #11) and multiplier (Bug #12) with minimal debugging.

## Recommendations for Next Session

### High Priority (Quick Wins)
1. **Debug fcmp failure** - Combinational module, likely simple edge case
2. **Debug fmin failure** - Combinational module, NaN or ±0 handling
3. **Debug fdiv accuracy** - Timeout fixed, algorithm bugs remain

### Medium Priority
4. **Apply special_case_handled to remaining FP modules** - Proactive bug prevention
   - fp_fma.v
   - fp_converter.v
   - fp_sqrt.v

### Lower Priority
5. **Debug fcvt/fcvt_w** - Format conversion edge cases
6. **Debug fmadd** - Most complex, save for last
7. **Debug recoding** - Pipeline integration issue

### Alternative Focus Areas
- Move to RV32D (double-precision) testing
- Work on FPGA synthesis and hardware deployment
- Implement system features (interrupts, timers, peripherals)
