# Session 2025-10-21: Bug #19 - FPU Writeback Path Fix

## Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Objective**: Debug why FPU converter results aren't reaching the FP register file
**Result**: ✅ SUCCESS - Fixed critical control unit bug blocking all INT→FP conversions
**Test Status**: RV32UF 4/11 (36%) - unchanged but writeback infrastructure now functional

---

## Problem Statement

From previous session (2025-10-20), the FPU converter was producing mathematically correct values:
```
Input:  0x00000002 (integer 2)
Output: 0x40000000 (float 2.0) ✓
```

However, the rv32uf-p-fcvt test was failing at test #5, and results weren't appearing in the FP register file.

---

## Investigation Process

### Step 1: Added Comprehensive Debug Instrumentation

Added debug output to trace the entire writeback path:
- **FPU output** (rtl/core/rv32i_core_pipelined.v:1420-1427)
- **EX/MEM pipeline stage** (rtl/core/rv32i_core_pipelined.v:1533-1541)
- **MEM/WB pipeline stage** (rtl/core/rv32i_core_pipelined.v:1751-1759)
- **WB stage FP register write** (rtl/core/rv32i_core_pipelined.v:705-714)

### Step 2: Ran Test with Debug Output

```bash
DEBUG_FPU_CONVERTER=1 ./tools/run_hex_tests.sh rv32uf-p-fcvt
```

**Key Finding**: NO output from [EXMEM], [MEMWB], or [WB] stages!
This meant `fp_reg_write` signal was NEVER being asserted.

### Step 3: Traced Signal Flow

Expected datapath for INT→FP conversions:
```
FPU.fp_result → ex_fp_result → exmem_fp_result → memwb_fp_result → wb_fp_data → FP register file
```

The FPU was producing correct output (`0x40000000`), but control signals weren't enabling writeback.

### Step 4: Found Root Cause

Examined control unit logic for FCVT instructions:

**File**: `rtl/core/control.v:437`

**Buggy Code**:
```verilog
if (funct7[6] == 1'b1) begin  // ❌ WRONG BIT!
  // FCVT.W.S/D (FP to int)
  reg_write = 1'b1;
  int_reg_write_fp = 1'b1;
  wb_sel = 3'b110;
end else begin
  // FCVT.S.W (int to FP)
  fp_reg_write = 1'b1;  // ← This branch NEVER taken for FCVT.S.W!
end
```

**Issue**: The code checked `funct7[6]` instead of `funct7[3]` to determine conversion direction.

**RISC-V Encodings**:
- FCVT.S.W (INT→FP): `funct7 = 1101000` (0x68), bit 3 = **1**
- FCVT.W.S (FP→INT): `funct7 = 1100000` (0x60), bit 3 = **0**

The control unit was checking the wrong bit, causing all INT→FP conversions to be decoded as FP→INT!

---

## Bug #19: Control Unit FCVT Direction Bit

### Root Cause
Same bug as Bug #17 (fixed in fpu.v) but duplicated in control.v:
- Checked `funct7[6]` instead of `funct7[3]` for INT↔FP direction
- ALL INT→FP conversions incorrectly decoded as FP→INT
- `fp_reg_write` signal NEVER set for FCVT.S.W/FCVT.S.WU

### Impact
**CRITICAL**: This bug completely blocked the writeback path for INT→FP conversions:
- Converter produced correct values
- BUT results never written to FP register file
- `fp_reg_write` signal never asserted

### Fix

**File**: `rtl/core/control.v:437`

**Before**:
```verilog
if (funct7[6] == 1'b1) begin
```

**After**:
```verilog
// Check funct7[3] for conversion direction (per RISC-V spec)
// funct7[3]=0: FP→INT (FCVT.W.S = 0x60), funct7[3]=1: INT→FP (FCVT.S.W = 0x68)
if (funct7[3] == 1'b0) begin
```

**Full corrected logic**:
```verilog
if (funct7[3] == 1'b0) begin
  // FCVT.W.S/D, FCVT.WU.S/D (FP to int)
  reg_write = 1'b1;         // Enable write to integer register
  int_reg_write_fp = 1'b1;  // Mark as FP-to-INT operation
  wb_sel = 3'b110;          // Select FP int_result for write-back
end else begin
  // FCVT.S.W, FCVT.S.WU (int to FP)
  fp_reg_write = 1'b1;      // Write to FP register ← NOW WORKS!
end
```

## Verification

### Debug Output After Fix

```
[FPU] done=1, fp_result=0x40000000, busy=0
[EXMEM] FP transfer: f10 <= 0x40000000 (fp_result)
[MEMWB] FP transfer: f10 <= 0x40000000 (wb_sel=000)
[WB] FP write: f10 <= 0x40000000 (wb_sel=000, from FPU)
```

✅ **Complete writeback path verified!**

### Test Execution Trace

Test #2: `fcvt.s.w f10, a0` with input `2`:
1. Converter produces `0x40000000` ✓
2. FPU outputs `fp_result=0x40000000` ✓
3. EX/MEM register captures value ✓
4. MEM/WB register captures value ✓
5. WB stage writes to `f10` ✓
6. FMV.X.S transfers `f10` → `a0` ✓
7. Result: `a0 = 0x40000000`, `a3 = 0x40000000` (expected) ✓

### Compliance Test Results

```
RV32UF Test Suite: 4/11 passing (36%)

PASSED:
  - rv32uf-p-fadd
  - rv32uf-p-fclass
  - rv32uf-p-ldst
  - rv32uf-p-move

FAILED:
  - rv32uf-p-fcmp
  - rv32uf-p-fcvt       (fails at test #5)
  - rv32uf-p-fcvt_w     (fails at test #17)
  - rv32uf-p-fdiv
  - rv32uf-p-fmadd
  - rv32uf-p-fmin
  - rv32uf-p-recoding
```

**Note**: Pass rate unchanged at 36%, BUT writeback infrastructure now functional.
Remaining failures due to other FPU edge cases, not the control bug.

## Files Modified

1. **rtl/core/control.v**
   - Line 437: Fixed funct7 bit check (funct7[6] → funct7[3])
   - Added comments explaining RISC-V spec encoding

2. **rtl/core/rv32i_core_pipelined.v** (debug instrumentation)
   - Lines 1420-1427: FPU output debug
   - Lines 705-714: WB stage FP register write debug
   - Lines 1533-1541: EX/MEM pipeline stage debug
   - Lines 1751-1759: MEM/WB pipeline stage debug

---

## Key Lessons

1. **Duplication of Bug #17**: The same funct7 bit error existed in TWO places:
   - Bug #17 (fixed 2025-10-20): `rtl/core/fpu.v:344-349`
   - Bug #19 (fixed 2025-10-21): `rtl/core/control.v:437`

   **Lesson**: Search for duplicate logic when fixing bugs!

2. **Debug Instrumentation Value**: Adding comprehensive pipeline tracing immediately revealed that `fp_reg_write` was never asserted, pointing directly to the control unit.

3. **Signal vs. Data Path**: The converter was PERFECT - the bug was in control signals, not datapath.

---

## Next Steps (Future Debugging)

### Remaining FCVT Issues

1. **Test #5 in rv32uf-p-fcvt**
   - Test: `fcvt.s.wu -2` (unsigned conversion of -2)
   - Expected: `4.2949673e9` (0xFFFFFF00 as unsigned)
   - Status: Test fails, needs investigation

2. **Test #17 in rv32uf-p-fcvt_w**
   - FP→INT conversion test
   - Status: Fails, edge case TBD

3. **Other failing FPU tests**
   - fcmp, fdiv, fmadd, fmin, recoding
   - All have edge case bugs to debug

### Recommended Approach

For each failing test:
1. Use `DEBUG_FCVT_TRACE` to see instruction-level execution
2. Identify exact test that fails
3. Check converter output for that specific input
4. Verify result matches IEEE 754-2008 specification

---

## Conclusion

✅ **Bug #19 FIXED** - Control unit now correctly identifies INT→FP conversions
✅ **Writeback path FUNCTIONAL** - Converter results reach FP register file
✅ **Infrastructure complete** - Ready for edge case debugging

**Impact**: Unblocked all INT→FP conversion testing. The path from FPU converter to FP register file is now fully operational. Remaining test failures are due to converter edge cases, not infrastructure bugs.

**Time investment**: ~2 hours of systematic debugging paid off with a critical fix!
