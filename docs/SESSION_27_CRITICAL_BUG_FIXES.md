# Session 27: Critical Bug Fixes - Forwarding & Address Decode

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Focus**: WB→ID forwarding bug, DMEM address decode bug
**Status**: ✅ Two critical bugs fixed!

---

## Overview

This session identified and fixed **two critical correctness bugs** that were preventing FreeRTOS from running properly:
1. **Forwarding Unit Bug**: WB→ID forwarding didn't respect `memwb_valid`
2. **Address Decode Bug**: DMEM mask limited access to 64KB instead of 1MB

Both bugs are now fixed, enabling proper memory operations and data forwarding!

---

## Bug #1: WB→ID Forwarding Not Gating on memwb_valid

### Problem Description

The forwarding unit was forwarding data from the WB stage without checking if the instruction was valid (not flushed). This caused stale/invalid data from flushed instructions to be forwarded to the ID stage.

**Symptoms**:
- Return address register (ra/x1) sometimes contained incorrect values
- Stack operations failed intermittently
- Random data corruption in registers

### Root Cause Analysis

**Location**: `rtl/core/forwarding_unit.v` lines 104-106, 124-126

**The Bug**:
```verilog
// WB stage forwarding (BEFORE FIX - INCORRECT!)
else if ((memwb_reg_write | memwb_int_reg_write_fp) &&
         (memwb_rd != 5'h0) &&
         (memwb_rd == id_rs1)) begin
  id_forward_a = 3'b001;  // Forward from WB stage
end
```

**The Problem**:
- Register file writes are gated by `memwb_valid` (line 880 of `rv32i_core_pipelined.v`)
- But forwarding unit only checked `memwb_reg_write`, NOT `memwb_valid`
- Result: Forwarding unit could forward garbage data from flushed instructions

**Example Failure Scenario**:
1. JAL instruction writes ra=0x22ac in WB stage, but `memwb_valid=0` (flushed)
2. Register file does NOT write ra (correctly gated by `memwb_valid`)
3. Forwarding unit DOES forward ra=0x22ac (incorrectly - missing valid check)
4. Following SW instruction gets forwarded 0x22ac, but register file has 0x0
5. SW writes 0x22ac to stack, but later LW reads 0x0 from register file
6. Result: Return address corruption, illegal instruction exception

### The Fix

**Added `memwb_valid` input to forwarding unit** (line 51):
```verilog
input  wire       memwb_valid,       // WB stage instruction is valid (not flushed)
```

**Gated all WB forwarding checks** (7 locations):
```verilog
// WB stage forwarding (AFTER FIX - CORRECT!)
else if ((memwb_reg_write | memwb_int_reg_write_fp) &&
         (memwb_rd != 5'h0) &&
         (memwb_rd == id_rs1) &&
         memwb_valid) begin  // ← CRITICAL: Only forward if valid!
  id_forward_a = 3'b001;
end
```

**Locations Fixed**:
1. ID stage integer RS1 forwarding (line 106)
2. ID stage integer RS2 forwarding (line 127)
3. EX stage integer RS1 forwarding (line 156)
4. EX stage integer RS2 forwarding (line 184)
5. ID stage FP RS1 forwarding (line 217)
6. ID stage FP RS2 forwarding (line 236)
7. ID stage FP RS3 forwarding (line 255)
8. EX stage FP RS1 forwarding (line 276)
9. EX stage FP RS2 forwarding (line 291)
10. EX stage FP RS3 forwarding (line 306)

**Wired signal in main core** (line 1238 of `rv32i_core_pipelined.v`):
```verilog
.memwb_valid(memwb_valid),
```

### Verification

**Test**: FreeRTOS boot with debug trace
**Results**:
```
[LINK-REG] Cycle 121: Writing ra(x1) = 0x000022ac (wb_sel=010, wen=1, valid=1)
[REG-ra] Cycle 121-129: ra(x1) value = 0x000022ac  ✅
```

**Before Fix**:
- ra would contain 0x0 after JAL
- Stack writes would save incorrect values
- Return from function would jump to 0x0 → illegal instruction

**After Fix**:
- ra correctly contains 0x22ac
- Forwarding respects instruction validity
- All quick regression tests pass (14/14)

## Bug #2: DMEM Address Decode Limited to 64KB

### Problem Description

The bus interconnect's DMEM address mask was configured for 64KB range, but FreeRTOS uses 1MB of DMEM. Any stack or heap access beyond 64KB would fail address decode, causing writes/reads to go nowhere.

**Symptoms**:
- Memory writes appeared to execute but data was lost
- Memory reads returned 0x0 instead of written values
- Stack operations failed for deep call stacks
- Heap allocations beyond 64KB failed silently

### Root Cause Analysis

**Location**: `rtl/interconnect/simple_bus.v` line 92

**The Bug**:
```verilog
localparam DMEM_BASE  = 32'h8000_0000;
localparam DMEM_MASK  = 32'hFFFF_0000;   // 64KB range (BUG!)
```

**Address Decode Logic**:
```verilog
assign sel_dmem = ((master_req_addr & DMEM_MASK) == DMEM_BASE);
```

**Example Failure**:
- FreeRTOS stack at address `0x800c_212c` (offset 0xc212c = 794KB from base)
- Address decode: `0x800c_212c & 0xFFFF_0000 = 0x800c_0000`
- Compare: `0x800c_0000 == 0x8000_0000` → **FALSE** ❌
- Result: `sel_dmem = 0`, write/read goes to `sel_none` (nowhere!)

**Debug Trace (Before Fix)**:
```
[MEM-WRITE] Cycle 125: addr=0x800c212c, data=0x000022ac, PC=0x00002408  ✅ Core sends write
[MEM-READ]  Cycle 149: addr=0x800c212c, PC=0x00002420
[LOAD-RA]   Cycle 149: loaded ra=0x00000000 from memory  ❌ Read returns 0!
```

**Problem**: Write never reached DMEM, read got default 0x0.

### The Fix

**Changed DMEM mask to support 1MB**:
```verilog
localparam DMEM_MASK  = 32'hFFF0_0000;   // 1MB range (was 64KB - BUG FIX Session 27)
```

**Mask Calculation**:
- 1MB = 2^20 bytes = 1048576 bytes
- Need bottom 20 bits variable: `0x000F_FFFF`
- Mask = `~0x000F_FFFF = 0xFFF0_0000`

**Address Decode (After Fix)**:
- Address `0x800c_212c & 0xFFF0_0000 = 0x8000_0000`
- Compare: `0x8000_0000 == 0x8000_0000` → **TRUE** ✅
- Result: `sel_dmem = 1`, write/read goes to DMEM!

### Verification

**Test**: FreeRTOS boot with memory debug trace
**Results**:
```
[MEM-WRITE] Cycle 125: addr=0x800c212c, data=0x000022ac, PC=0x00002408  ✅
[MEM-READ]  Cycle 149: addr=0x800c212c, PC=0x00002420
[LOAD-RA]   Cycle 149: loaded ra=0x000022ac from memory  ✅ Correct value!
```

**Before Fix**:
- Only first 64KB of DMEM accessible
- Stack beyond 64KB would fail
- FreeRTOS could not run (needs ~1MB for heap/stack/BSS)

**After Fix**:
- Full 1MB DMEM accessible
- Stack operations work at any offset
- All quick regression tests pass (14/14)

## Testing Results

### Quick Regression
```bash
make test-quick
```
**Result**: ✅ 14/14 tests passing (100%)

### FreeRTOS Boot Test
```bash
env XLEN=32 timeout 60s ./tools/test_freertos.sh
```

**Progress**:
- ✅ BSS clear accelerator: 260KB in 1 cycle (199k cycles saved)
- ✅ main() reached at cycle 95
- ✅ uart_init() completed at cycle 115
- ✅ First UART character transmitted at cycle 145
- ✅ Return address correctly forwarded: ra=0x22ac
- ✅ Stack operations work: write/read from 0x800c212c
- ✅ Scheduler milestone reached at cycle 1001
- ⚠️ Simulation runs to completion (500k cycles), but only 1 UART character output
- ⚠️ Illegal instruction exceptions persist (mcause=2, various mepc values)

**Comparison**:
- **Session 25**: 1 UART character, exception loop at cycle 159
- **Session 26**: Root cause identified - return address corruption
- **Session 27**: Both bugs fixed, simulation runs full 500k cycles!

## Impact Analysis

### Scope of Bugs

**Bug #1 (Forwarding)**:
- **Severity**: CRITICAL - Correctness bug affecting all programs
- **Impact**: Any instruction that creates a RAW hazard with a flushed instruction could get wrong data
- **Trigger**: Exceptions, interrupts, branch mispredictions that flush WB stage
- **Detection**: Difficult - intermittent, depends on timing

**Bug #2 (Address Decode)**:
- **Severity**: CRITICAL - Prevents use of >64KB memory
- **Impact**: Any program using >64KB DMEM would fail silently
- **Trigger**: Stack beyond 64KB, heap allocations, large BSS
- **Detection**: Easy - memory operations fail, loads return 0x0

### Why Not Caught Earlier?

**Test Suite Limitations**:
1. All compliance tests use <64KB of memory
2. Test programs have simple call stacks (fit in 64KB)
3. No tests specifically exercise deep call stacks
4. No tests with large heap allocations

**FreeRTOS Exposure**:
- Needs 260KB BSS (cleared by accelerator)
- Stack grows beyond 64KB with task context switching
- Heap for dynamic allocations

### Lessons Learned

1. **Address decode masks must match memory size parameters**
   - Document expected memory sizes clearly
   - Add assertions to check mask correctness

2. **Forwarding must respect instruction validity**
   - All forwarding paths must check valid signals
   - Flushed instructions should never forward data

3. **Need better memory stress tests**
   - Tests that use >64KB of memory
   - Deep call stack tests (recursive functions)
   - Heap allocation stress tests

## Next Steps (Session 28)

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Debug Illegal Instruction Exceptions**
   - Exception cause=2 (illegal instruction) at various PC values
   - Most common: mepc=0x2500 (trap handler?)
   - Need to disassemble and identify problematic instructions

2. **UART Output Investigation**
   - Only 1 character (0x0a = newline) transmitted
   - Expected: Full banner string "FreeRTOS RV1 Demo Starting...\n"
   - Likely: printf/puts still has issues after first character

3. **Exception Handler Analysis**
   - Trap handler at 0x2500 appears to be looping
   - Need to check if return address is correct
   - May need to verify trap delegation settings

### Future Improvements

1. **Add Memory Size Assertions**
   - Check DMEM_MASK matches actual memory size
   - Warn if address decode doesn't cover full range

2. **Memory Stress Tests**
   - Create test with >64KB stack usage
   - Add heap allocation test with 1MB usage
   - Test address decode boundaries

3. **Forwarding Unit Test**
   - Create test that triggers WB forwarding with flush
   - Verify `memwb_valid` gating works correctly
   - Add to compliance test suite

## Conclusion

Session 27 successfully identified and fixed two critical correctness bugs:

1. ✅ **Forwarding Bug**: WB→ID forwarding now properly respects `memwb_valid`
2. ✅ **Address Decode Bug**: DMEM now accessible for full 1MB range

These fixes enable FreeRTOS to progress significantly further in boot process:
- Return addresses preserved correctly through function calls
- Stack operations work at any memory offset
- Simulation runs to completion without crashing

However, challenges remain:
- Only 1 UART character output (expected full banner)
- Illegal instruction exceptions in trap handler
- Need to debug printf/puts path further

**Next session** will focus on trap handler debugging and achieving full UART banner output.
