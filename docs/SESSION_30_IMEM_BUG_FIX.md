# Session 30: IMEM Read Bug - Root Cause Fixed! üéâ

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Impact**: CRITICAL - Fixes memory corruption blocking FreeRTOS execution

## Summary

Fixed critical bug where instruction memory returned zeros for addresses ‚â•0x210c, causing illegal instruction exceptions. Root cause was unified memory architecture allowing DMEM stores to corrupt IMEM.

## Problem Description

### Symptoms
- Instruction fetch from address 0x210c returned `0x00000000` (NOP)
- Expected instruction: `0x27068693` (ADDI a3, a3, 624)
- Memory initialized correctly but corrupted during runtime
- FreeRTOS trapped with illegal instruction exception at PC 0x210c

### Evidence Trail
1. Memory contains correct data after `$readmemh` ‚úì
2. Memory correct at cycle 0 (before reset) ‚úì
3. Memory correct at cycle 1 (after reset) ‚úì
4. Memory contains ZEROS at cycle 605 (fetch time) ‚úó
5. IMEM overwrite detector triggered at cycles 292, 367, 441, 561
6. Values written: `0x000022d2`, `0x000022e2`, `0x000022ee`, `0x00000000`
7. No IMEM writes detected through `mem_write` signal
8. BSS fast-clear writes to DMEM[0x210c] during initialization

## Root Cause

**Two-part architectural bug in unified memory implementation:**

### Part 1: DMEM Loaded from Same Hex File as IMEM

**Problem**: Both IMEM and DMEM initialized from same hex file
```verilog
// rv_soc.v (BEFORE FIX)
rv_core_pipelined #(
  .MEM_FILE(MEM_FILE)  // IMEM gets hex file
) core (...);

dmem_bus_adapter #(
  .MEM_FILE(MEM_FILE)  // DMEM ALSO gets hex file! ‚ùå
) dmem_adapter (...);
```

**Consequence**:
- IMEM[0x210c] = 0x93 (code)
- DMEM[0x210c] = 0x93 (same data)
- BSS section in DMEM overlaps code in IMEM at same indices

### Part 2: ALL Stores Write to BOTH DMEM and IMEM

**Problem**: FENCE.I support connects stores to IMEM without address filtering
```verilog
// rv32i_core_pipelined.v (BEFORE FIX)
instruction_memory #(...) imem (
  .mem_write(exmem_mem_write && exmem_valid && !exception),  // ‚ùå No address check!
  .write_addr(exmem_alu_result),  // Could be DMEM address 0x8000210c
  ...
);
```

**Consequence**:
- Store to DMEM address `0x8000210c` ‚Üí ALU result = `0x8000210c`
- IMEM masks address: `0x8000210c & 0xFFFF = 0x210c`
- Store writes to **both** DMEM[0x8000210c] AND IMEM[0x210c]
- Code at IMEM[0x210c] gets overwritten with data!

### The Perfect Storm

1. Linker places BSS at DMEM 0x80000000+
2. BSS variable happens to be at 0x8000210c
3. Program writes data values to BSS variable
4. Write goes to DMEM[0x8000210c] (correct)
5. Write ALSO goes to IMEM[0x210c] (BUG!)
6. Code at 0x210c gets corrupted
7. Instruction fetch returns corrupted data
8. Illegal instruction exception

## Solution

### Fix #1: Don't Load DMEM from Hex File

**File**: `rtl/rv_soc.v` line 260

```verilog
// BEFORE
dmem_bus_adapter #(
  .XLEN(XLEN),
  .FLEN(`FLEN),
  .MEM_SIZE(DMEM_SIZE),
  .MEM_FILE(MEM_FILE)  // ‚ùå Wrong!
) dmem_adapter (...);

// AFTER
dmem_bus_adapter #(
  .XLEN(XLEN),
  .FLEN(`FLEN),
  .MEM_SIZE(DMEM_SIZE),
  .MEM_FILE("")  // ‚úÖ DMEM should NOT be loaded from hex file
) dmem_adapter (...);
```

**Rationale**:
- Harvard architecture has separate I/D memory
- Only IMEM should be initialized from program binary
- DMEM starts zero-initialized
- `.data` section is copied by startup code (startup.S)

### Fix #2: Filter IMEM Writes by Address

**File**: `rtl/core/rv32i_core_pipelined.v` lines 672-690

```verilog
// BEFORE
instruction_memory #(...) imem (
  .clk(clk),
  .addr(pc_current),
  .instruction(if_instruction_raw),
  .mem_write(exmem_mem_write && exmem_valid && !exception),  // ‚ùå No filtering!
  .write_addr(exmem_alu_result),
  ...
);

// AFTER
// IMEM write enable - only for addresses in IMEM range (0x0-0xFFFF for 64KB IMEM)
// This prevents DMEM stores (e.g., 0x80000000) from corrupting IMEM
wire imem_write_enable = exmem_mem_write && exmem_valid && !exception &&
                         (exmem_alu_result < IMEM_SIZE);  // ‚úÖ Address check!

instruction_memory #(...) imem (
  .clk(clk),
  .addr(pc_current),
  .instruction(if_instruction_raw),
  .mem_write(imem_write_enable),  // ‚úÖ Filtered!
  .write_addr(exmem_alu_result),
  ...
);
```

**Rationale**:
- FENCE.I support requires IMEM to be writable
- Only stores to IMEM address range (0x0-0xFFFF) should write to IMEM
- Stores to DMEM range (0x80000000+) should NOT write to IMEM
- Simple comparison: `exmem_alu_result < IMEM_SIZE`

## Verification

### Test Results

**Before Fix**:
```
[IMEM-OVERWRITE-DETECTOR] Cycle 292: mem[0x210c] = 0xd2  ‚ùå
[IMEM-OVERWRITE-DETECTOR] Cycle 367: mem[0x210c] = 0xe2  ‚ùå
[IMEM-OVERWRITE-DETECTOR] Cycle 441: mem[0x210c] = 0xee  ‚ùå
[IMEM-OVERWRITE-DETECTOR] Cycle 561: mem[0x210c] = 0x00  ‚ùå
[IMEM-FETCH] addr=0x210c, instr=0x00000000  ‚ùå WRONG!
```

**After Fix**:
```
[IMEM-OVERWRITE-DETECTOR] Only at TIME=0 (initialization)  ‚úÖ
[IMEM-FETCH] addr=0x210c, instr=0x27068693  ‚úÖ CORRECT!
  mem[0x210c]=0x93, mem[0x210d]=0x86, mem[0x210e]=0x06, mem[0x210f]=0x27
```

### Regression Testing
- ‚úÖ Quick regression: 14/14 tests passing
- ‚úÖ FreeRTOS boots past address 0x210c
- ‚úÖ No performance impact (single comparison added)
- ‚úÖ FENCE.I still functional for valid self-modifying code

### What Works Now
1. ‚úÖ IMEM remains unchanged during execution
2. ‚úÖ DMEM stores don't corrupt IMEM
3. ‚úÖ FreeRTOS executes past problematic address
4. ‚úÖ Instruction at 0x210c reads correctly
5. ‚úÖ BSS section properly isolated in DMEM

## Investigation Timeline

1. **Initial observation**: IMEM returns zeros at runtime
2. **Hypothesis 1**: Array indexing width mismatch ‚Üí Tested with explicit truncation ‚Üí Not the issue
3. **Hypothesis 2**: Hex file corruption ‚Üí Checked file contents ‚Üí Correct data
4. **Hypothesis 3**: $readmemh bug ‚Üí Tested without @ directives ‚Üí Not the issue
5. **Hypothesis 4**: NOP initialization loop overwrites ‚Üí Disabled loop ‚Üí Not the issue
6. **Breakthrough**: Added overwrite detector ‚Üí Found runtime corruption at cycles 292, 367, 441, 561!
7. **Key insight**: Values written (0x22d2, 0x22e2, 0x22ee) are code addresses ‚Üí Data being written to IMEM!
8. **Discovery**: ALL stores write to IMEM (FENCE.I support)
9. **Root cause**: No address filtering on IMEM writes + unified memory initialization

## Impact

**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Scope**: Affects any program that:
- Uses data memory (virtually all programs)
- Has DMEM addresses with same low 16 bits as code addresses
- Relies on code integrity during execution

**Without this fix**:
- FreeRTOS cannot boot
- Most complex programs will fail
- Memory corruption is silent and hard to debug
- FENCE.I support inadvertently breaks Harvard architecture

## Lessons Learned

1. **Unified memory requires careful address filtering** - Can't blindly write to both I/D memory
2. **Test with diverse address patterns** - Bug only manifested when DMEM writes hit specific indices
3. **Monitor at multiple abstraction levels** - RTL monitors missed testbench-level issues
4. **Architecture assumptions matter** - Linker assumed Harvard, implementation was unified
5. **FENCE.I needs address checks** - Self-modifying code support must respect memory regions

### Modified (2 files)
- `rtl/rv_soc.v` - Removed MEM_FILE from DMEM initialization

### Debug/Test (not committed)
- `rtl/memory/instruction_memory.v` - Temporary debug monitors

## Future Improvements

1. **Add assertions** - Check IMEM writes are only to valid ranges
2. **Document architecture** - Clarify Harvard vs unified memory assumptions
3. **Test coverage** - Add test for cross-memory-region isolation
4. **Linker validation** - Ensure sections don't overlap in index space
