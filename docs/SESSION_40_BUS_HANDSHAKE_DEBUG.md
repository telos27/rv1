# Session 40: Bus Handshake Debug - Root Cause Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: üîç **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED** - bus_req_ready signal not used by core
**Priority**: üî• **CRITICAL** - Blocks all FreeRTOS development

---

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive debug trace analysis, I've identified the **true root cause** of the UART character duplication bug:

**THE CORE COMPLETELY IGNORES THE `bus_req_ready` SIGNAL!**

The `bus_req_ready` input exists (line 33 of `rv32i_core_pipelined.v`) but is **NEVER USED** in any logic. When peripherals assert `ready=0` to indicate they can't accept a transaction, the core:
1. Ignores the signal
2. Continues advancing the pipeline
3. Issues multiple write requests for different instructions
4. Result: Character duplication in UART output

---

## Debug Methodology

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Debug Trace ‚úÖ

Generated cycle-accurate traces with 3-level debug instrumentation:
- **CORE level**: `DEBUG_UART_CORE=1` - tracks arb_mem_write_pulse
- **BUS level**: `DEBUG_UART_BUS=1` - tracks bus transactions
- **FIFO level**: `DEBUG_UART_FIFO=1` - tracks UART FIFO operations

**Key Finding** from trace analysis:
```
[CORE-UART-WR] PC=0x000023fe PCprev=0x000023fc write_pulse=1 bus_req_ready=0
[CORE-UART-WR] PC=0x000023fe PCprev=0x000023fc write_pulse=1 bus_req_ready=1
[CORE-UART-WR] PC=0x000023fe PCprev=0x000023fc write_pulse=1 bus_req_ready=0
```

**Analysis**:
- SAME PC (0x23fe) generates MULTIPLE write_pulse=1 signals
- `bus_req_ready` alternates between 0 and 1
- `mem_stage_new_instr=1` for every write (INCORRECT!)
- This proves the core treats the SAME instruction as "new" multiple times

---

## Root Cause Details

### Problem 1: `bus_req_ready` Never Used

**File**: `rtl/core/rv32i_core_pipelined.v`

**Line 33**: Signal declared as input
```verilog
input  wire             bus_req_ready,
```

**Usage**: NONE! Grep shows only the declaration:
```bash
$ grep -n "bus_req_ready" rtl/core/rv32i_core_pipelined.v
33:  input  wire             bus_req_ready,
```

**Impact**:
- When UART FIFO is full, it asserts `uart_req_ready=0`
- Bus interconnect propagates this as `bus_req_ready=0`
- Core completely ignores it and keeps issuing write requests
- Multiple writes for the same character ‚Üí duplication

### Problem 2: Pipeline Doesn't Stall on Bus Not Ready

**Current `hold_exmem` logic** (lines 273-276):
```verilog
assign hold_exmem = (idex_is_mul_div && idex_valid && !ex_mul_div_ready) ||
                    (idex_is_atomic && idex_valid && !ex_atomic_done) ||
                    (idex_fp_alu_en && idex_valid && !ex_fpu_done) ||
                    mmu_busy;
```

**Missing**: No condition for `!bus_req_ready`!

**Result**:
- MEM stage continues with pending memory operation
- EX stage instruction advances to MEM
- New instruction generates new write_pulse
- Duplicate writes issued

### Problem 3: `mem_stage_new_instr` Doesn't Account for Retry

**Current logic** (line 2401):
```verilog
wire mem_stage_new_instr = exmem_valid && ((exmem_pc != exmem_pc_prev) || !exmem_valid_prev);
```

**Issue**: When bus isn't ready:
1. Cycle N: Instruction A at PC=0x23fe enters MEM, issues write, `ready=0`
2. `exmem_pc_prev` updated to 0x23fe (UNCONDITIONALLY every cycle!)
3. Instruction A stays in MEM (because `hold_exmem` should prevent advancement, but doesn't check `bus_req_ready`)
4. Actually, pipeline doesn't hold, so Instruction B enters MEM at PC=0x2400
5. `mem_stage_new_instr = (0x2400 != 0x23fe) = 1` ‚úì Correct - NEW instruction
6. But wait - what if it's the SAME instruction looping? PC can be 0x23fe again!

**The real issue**: Without proper stalling, the pipeline keeps advancing and each instruction issues its own write.

---

## Fix Attempts (All Failed or Caused Regressions)

### Attempt 1: Add `bus_req_ready` to `hold_exmem` ‚ùå

**Code**:
```verilog
assign hold_exmem = ... ||
                    (exmem_valid && (exmem_mem_read || exmem_mem_write) && !bus_req_ready);
```

**Result**: **DEADLOCK**
- CPU stuck at PC 0x22a4 after 100 cycles
- Holding EX/MEM prevents pipeline progress
- But MEM stage still has the instruction that needs bus
- Creates circular dependency: Can't advance until bus ready, but bus waiting for instruction

### Attempt 2: Track `write_pending` with `bus_req_ready` ‚ùå

**Code**:
```verilog
reg write_pending;
always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (dmem_mem_write && mem_stage_new_instr && !bus_req_ready)
    write_pending <= 1'b1;
  else if (write_pending && bus_req_ready)
    write_pending <= 1'b0;
end

wire arb_mem_write_pulse = ... && !write_pending;
```

**Result**: **STILL DUPLICATES**
- Logic flaw: Sets `pending=1` only when `ready=0`
- If write completes in same cycle (`ready=1`), never sets pending
- Next instruction sees `pending=0`, issues another write

### Attempt 3: Track `write_issued_for_current_pc` ‚ùå

**Code**:
```verilog
reg write_issued_for_current_pc;
reg [XLEN-1:0] write_issued_pc;

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (arb_mem_write_pulse) begin
    write_issued_for_current_pc <= 1'b1;
    write_issued_pc <= exmem_pc;
  end else if (exmem_pc != write_issued_pc) begin
    write_issued_for_current_pc <= 1'b0;
  end
end

wire arb_mem_write_pulse = ... && !write_issued_for_current_pc;
```

**Result**: **REBOOT LOOP**
- BSS fast-clear activates multiple times (program rebooting)
- Broke fundamental pipeline operation
- Likely issue: Prevents legitimate writes when PC repeats (loops)

---

## Why This Is So Difficult to Fix

### Challenge 1: Bus Protocol Mismatch

**Current**: One-way request with ignored handshake
- Core issues `bus_req_valid` and `bus_req_we`
- Peripheral responds with `bus_req_ready`
- Core doesn't wait for `ready`!

**Needed**: Proper request-acknowledge handshake
- Core issues request and WAITS
- Peripheral acknowledges when ready
- Core only advances when acknowledged

### Challenge 2: Pipeline Complexity

Simply holding the pipeline creates problems:
1. **Deadlock**: Hold EX/MEM ‚Üí Can't progress ‚Üí Bus stuck ‚Üí Ready never asserted
2. **Forwarding**: Held instructions need forwarding paths
3. **Exceptions**: What if held instruction causes exception?
4. **Atomics**: Multi-cycle atomic ops already use hold mechanism

### Challenge 3: DMEM vs MMIO

**DMEM** (main memory):
- Always ready (single-cycle response)
- Current design works fine

**MMIO** (peripherals like UART):
- May not be ready (FIFO full, busy, etc.)
- Needs proper handshaking

**Problem**: Need to distinguish and handle differently!

---

## Recommended Solution

After analyzing all attempts, the proper fix requires **architectural changes**:

### Option A: Implement Proper Bus Handshaking (RECOMMENDED)

**Changes needed**:

1. **Add stall logic based on `bus_req_ready`**:
```verilog
// Hold MEM‚ÜíWB advancement when bus transaction pending
wire hold_memwb = (exmem_mem_read || exmem_mem_write) &&
                  exmem_valid &&
                  !bus_req_ready;

// Also prevent new instructions entering MEM
wire hold_exmem = ... ||
                  ((exmem_mem_read || exmem_mem_write) && !bus_req_ready);
```

2. **Track transaction state**:
```verilog
reg bus_transaction_active;

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (bus_req_valid && !bus_req_ready)
    bus_transaction_active <= 1'b1;
  else if (bus_req_ready)
    bus_transaction_active <= 1'b0;
end
```

3. **Gate write pulse on transaction completion**:
```verilog
wire arb_mem_write_pulse = dmem_mem_write &&
                           mem_stage_new_instr &&
                           !bus_transaction_active;
```

**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours
- Implementation: 2-3 hours
- Testing: 1-2 hours
- Regression verification: 1 hour

### Option B: Split DMEM and MMIO Paths (ALTERNATIVE)

**Idea**: Separate fast path (DMEM) from slow path (MMIO)

**Changes**:
- DMEM: Direct connection, no handshaking (always ready)
- MMIO: Buffered with FIFO, proper handshaking
- Arbiter decides which path based on address

**Pros**:
- DMEM performance unaffected
- MMIO gets proper flow control

**Cons**:
- More complex
- Requires significant refactoring

**Estimated Effort**: 8-12 hours

### Option C: Accept Duplication, Fix at Higher Level (NOT RECOMMENDED)

**Idea**: Add de-duplication logic in UART or software

**Cons**:
- Doesn't fix root cause
- Will affect ALL MMIO (GPIO, timers, DMA, etc.)
- Wrong architectural layer

5. **Run full regression** - Ensure no breakage (1 hour)

**Total Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours for complete fix

## Lessons Learned

1. **Bus protocol violations are insidious**:
   - Tests pass because DMEM is always ready
   - Only shows up with slow peripherals (UART, GPIO, etc.)
   - Hard to debug without cycle-accurate traces

2. **Pipeline stalling is complex**:
   - Can't just hold one stage without considering dependencies
   - Need proper state machines for multi-cycle operations
   - Easy to create deadlocks or break forwarding

3. **Architectural assumptions matter**:
   - Design assumed all memory was fast (DMEM model)
   - Didn't account for MMIO with variable latency
   - Retrofit is harder than designing it right initially

4. **Debug instrumentation is invaluable**:
   - 3-level tracing (CORE/BUS/FIFO) was key to finding root cause
   - Without it, would still be guessing
   - Time spent on instrumentation pays off quickly
