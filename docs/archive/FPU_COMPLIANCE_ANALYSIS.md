## Failure Pattern Analysis

### Pattern 1: Test #5 Failures (6 tests) ⚠️ **CRITICAL CLUSTER**

**Tests**: fcvt, fcvt_w, fdiv, fmadd, recoding
**Common trait**: All fail at exactly the same test number

#### What Test #5 Tests:

1. **fcvt.S** (INT→FP conversion)
   - Test #5: `fcvt.s.wu -2` → `4.2949673e9` (unsigned conversion)
   - Large unsigned value that may trigger rounding/inexact

2. **fcvt_w.S** (FP→INT conversion)
   - Test #5: `fcvt.w.s 0.9, rtz` → `0` with flag `NX=1` (inexact)
   - Requires proper inexact flag on fractional truncation

3. **fdiv.S** (FP Division)
   - Test #5: Likely division operation with rounding
   - Need to check exact test case

4. **fmadd.S** (Fused Multiply-Add)
   - Test #5: FMA operation with specific flag requirements
   - Need to check exact test case

5. **recoding.S** (NaN Boxing)
   - Test #5: NaN-boxing validation for single-precision in 64-bit registers

#### Hypothesis for Test #5 Failures:

**Most Likely**: Exception flag (FFLAGS) handling issue
- Test #5 in fcvt_w explicitly checks for `NX` (inexact) flag = 0x01
- Converter/divider modules may not be setting flags correctly
- Or flags are being contaminated by previous operations

**Possible Issues**:
1. ✅ ~~Flag contamination from previous ops~~ (Fixed in Bug #7b, #10, #12)
2. ❌ **NEW**: FP→INT converter not setting inexact flag
3. ❌ **NEW**: INT→FP converter not handling large unsigned values
4. ❌ **NEW**: Rounding mode (RTZ) not applied correctly in conversions

---

### Pattern 2: Mid-Test Failures (2 tests)

#### fcmp - Failed at test #13
**Category**: Floating-point comparison (FEQ, FLT, FLE)
**Progress**: 12 tests passed before failure
**Likely issue**: Edge case in comparison (NaN handling, signed zero, etc.)

**Next step**: Examine what test #13 is comparing

#### fmin - Failed at test #15
**Category**: FMIN/FMAX operations
**Progress**: 14 tests passed before failure
**Likely issue**: NaN propagation or signed zero handling

**FMIN/FMAX Spec Requirements**:
- If either input is NaN, return canonical NaN
- FMIN(-0, +0) = -0 (must distinguish signed zeros)
- FMAX(-0, +0) = +0

---

## Root Cause Investigation

### Investigation Priority 1: FP Converter Modules

Based on Pattern 1 (test #5 cluster), the issue is likely in:

1. **rtl/core/fp_converter.v**
   - INT→FP conversion (FCVT.S.W, FCVT.S.WU)
   - FP→INT conversion (FCVT.W.S, FCVT.WU.S)
   - Rounding mode handling
   - **FFLAGS generation** ⚠️ **CRITICAL**

**Specific checks needed**:
- [ ] Does FCVT.W.S set NX flag when truncating fractional part?
- [ ] Does FCVT.S.WU handle large unsigned values correctly?
- [ ] Are rounding modes (RTZ, RNE, etc.) applied correctly?
- [ ] Is the special_case_handled pattern applied? (Bug #10 fix)

### Investigation Priority 2: FP Divider

**rtl/core/fp_divider.v** - Already fixed Bug #11 (timeout), but may have flag issues:
- [ ] Does division set correct exception flags?
- [ ] Is NX flag set for inexact results?
- [ ] Are special cases (0/0, Inf/Inf) handled correctly?

### Investigation Priority 3: FP Compare & Min/Max

**rtl/core/fp_compare.v** and **rtl/core/fp_minmax.v**:
- [ ] NaN handling in comparisons
- [ ] Signed zero handling (-0 vs +0)
- [ ] Quiet NaN vs Signaling NaN

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Highest Impact):

1. **Examine FP Converter Inexact Flag**
   File: `rtl/core/fp_converter.v`
   - Check FCVT.W.S: Does it set NX when result has fractional part?
   - Check FCVT.S.WU: Does it handle unsigned overflow correctly?
   - Verify rounding mode application

2. **Run Single Test Debug**
   Run fcvt_w test with FPU debug output to see exact failure:
   ```bash
   DEBUG_FPU=1 ./tools/run_hex_tests.sh rv32uf-p-fcvt_w
   ```

3. **Apply special_case_handled Pattern**
   If not already present, apply the pattern from Bug #10 fix to:
   - fp_converter.v
   - fp_fma.v (for fmadd test)

### Secondary Actions:

4. **Debug fcmp test #13**
   Find what comparison is failing at test #13

5. **Debug fmin test #15**
   Check signed zero and NaN handling

---

## Progress Tracking

### Tests by Difficulty (Estimated):

**Easy wins** (1-2 bug fixes away):
- fcvt_w, fcvt - Likely just converter flag issues

**Medium** (2-3 bug fixes):
- fdiv - Already fixed timeout, may need flag fixes
- fmadd - Check FMA flag handling
- recoding - NaN boxing edge case

**Harder** (specific edge cases):
- fcmp - Comparison edge case at test #13
- fmin - Min/max signed zero or NaN handling at test #15

---

## Historical Context

### Bugs Fixed (2025-10-13 to 2025-10-20):

1. Bug #7: CSR-FPU pipeline hazard (EX/MEM/WB stages)
2. Bug #7b: FP load flag contamination ✅ **Major improvement**
3. Bug #8: FP multiplier bit extraction
4. Bug #9: FP multiplier normalization
5. Bug #10: FP adder special case flag contamination ✅ **fadd now passing**
6. Bug #11: FP divider timeout (49,999 → 146 cycles) ✅ **342x faster**
7. Bug #12: FP multiplier special case flags

**Result**: 27% → 36% pass rate (+9%)

---

## Conclusion

The clustered failures at test #5 across 6 different test suites strongly suggest a **systematic issue in exception flag handling** for conversion and rounding operations, rather than isolated bugs.

**Recommended focus**: Start with `fp_converter.v` inexact flag generation, as this is the most likely common root cause affecting fcvt, fcvt_w, and potentially propagating to other operations.

**Expected impact**: Fixing converter flags could potentially resolve 2-3 tests immediately (fcvt, fcvt_w, possibly recoding).
