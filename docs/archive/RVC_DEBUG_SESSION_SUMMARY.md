# RV32C Debugging Session Summary - 2025-10-21

## Session Overview

**Goal**: Fix the `rv32uc-p-rvc` test timeout issue
**Duration**: ~3 hours
**Status**: Partial success - Fixed 3 critical bugs, but RV32C test still fails

## Bugs Fixed This Session

### ✅ Bug #29: Illegal Compressed Instruction Detection
- **Impact**: Critical - Illegal compressed instructions executed instead of trapping
- **Root Cause**: RVC decoder's `illegal_instr` flag was not being checked by the core
- **Fix**: Added `is_compressed` pipeline flag, buffered illegal signal, combined with control unit's illegal detection

### ✅ Bug #30: MRET/SRET Jump Signal
- **Impact**: Critical - MRET/SRET jumped to wrong addresses, causing PC corruption
- **Root Cause**: Control unit set `jump=1` for MRET/SRET in EX stage, but flush signals activate in MEM stage
- **Fix**: Changed MRET/SRET to NOT set jump signal, letting mret_flush/sret_flush handle PC correctly

### ✅ Bug #31: RVC Decoder Quadrant 3 Handling
- **Impact**: Critical - Would mark all 32-bit instructions as illegal (blocking issue for Bug #29 fix)
- **Root Cause**: RVC decoder treated 32-bit instructions (opcode=11) as "illegal compressed instructions"
- **Fix**: Changed quadrant 3 to set `illegal_instr=0` for 32-bit instructions

## Current Test Results

**Overall**: 81% pass rate (66/81 tests) - **MAINTAINED**

| Extension | Tests | Passed | Failed | Pass Rate |
|-----------|-------|--------|--------|-----------|
| RV32I     | 37    | 37     | 0      | 100% ✅   |
| RV32M     | 8     | 8      | 0      | 100% ✅   |
| RV32A     | 10    | 10     | 0      | 100% ✅   |
| RV32UF    | 11    | 6      | 5      | 55%       |
| RV32UD    | 9     | 0      | 9      | 0%        |
| RV32C     | 1     | 0      | 1      | 0% ⚠️     |

### Failing Tests
- **RV32UF** (5 tests): fcvt_w, fdiv, fmadd, fmin, recoding - FPU edge cases
- **RV32UD** (9 tests): All double-precision FP tests - Not implemented
- **RV32C** (1 test): rv32uc-p-rvc - Still investigating

## RV32C Test Status

The `rv32uc-p-rvc` test **still times out** after these fixes, indicating additional bugs remain.

### What We Know Works
- ✅ Illegal compressed instruction detection (traps correctly)
- ✅ MRET/SRET return to correct addresses
- ✅ 32-bit instructions are not falsely marked as illegal
- ✅ All existing tests still pass (no regressions)

### What Still Doesn't Work
The test enters an infinite loop in the `write_tohost` polling loop, never reaching actual compressed instruction test cases. This suggests:

1. **Possible root causes**:
   - PC increment logic bug with compressed instructions
   - RVC decoder producing wrong decompressed instructions
   - Branch/jump target calculation errors with compressed instructions
   - Instruction fetch alignment issues at half-word boundaries
   - Test setup code fails before reaching actual RVC tests

2. **Observed behavior** (from debug traces):
   - Test gets stuck in loop: PC cycles 0x80000050 → 0x80000054 → 0x8000003c → 0x8000004c → repeat
   - This is the `write_tohost` loop, suggesting test completed or failed very early
   - Never reaches the actual compressed instruction test cases (which start around 0x80002000+)

## Debug Methodology Used

1. **Traced PC progression** - Added cycle-by-cycle PC logging to see execution flow
2. **Compared pipeline stages** - Tracked IF, ID, EX stages to understand signal timing
3. **Analyzed instruction encoding** - Decoded instructions manually to verify expected behavior
4. **Used waveform debugging** - Generated VCD files for detailed signal analysis
5. **Incremental testing** - Verified each fix didn't break existing tests

## Files Modified This Session

### RTL Changes
- `rtl/core/ifid_register.v` - Added `is_compressed` pipeline signal
- `rtl/core/rv32i_core_pipelined.v` - Added illegal compressed instruction detection
- `rtl/core/control.v` - Fixed MRET/SRET jump signal
- `rtl/core/rvc_decoder.v` - Fixed quadrant 3 handling

### Documentation
- `docs/BUG_29_30_31_RVC_FIXES.md` - Detailed documentation of all three bugs

### Testbench Changes (Temporary)
- `tb/integration/tb_core_pipelined.v` - Added/removed debug traces (restored to original)

## Next Session Priorities

### High Priority: Complete RV32C Debug

1. **Add comprehensive RVC decoder verification**:
   - Create unit test for RVC decoder with all compressed instruction types
   - Verify decoder output matches expected decompressed instructions
   - Test all quadrants (Q0, Q1, Q2)

2. **Investigate PC increment logic**:
   - Verify `pc_plus_2` vs `pc_plus_4` selection is correct
   - Check `if_is_compressed` signal timing and accuracy
   - Test PC increment with mixed 16/32-bit instruction streams

3. **Debug instruction fetch alignment**:
   - Verify half-word boundary alignment in instruction_memory.v
   - Check if fetching from odd addresses (2-byte aligned) works correctly
   - Test with instructions at various alignments

4. **Trace actual RVC test execution**:
   - Add more detailed logging of first 500 cycles
   - Identify exactly where test setup fails
   - Compare with expected test flow from objdump

5. **Consider alternative approaches**:
   - Test with simpler custom RVC programs first
   - Build up complexity: single compressed instruction → sequences → official test
   - May need to fix RVC decoder instruction-by-instruction

### Medium Priority: FPU Improvements

Continue work on RV32UF/RV32UD failures (FPU edge cases and double-precision support)

## Key Insights

1. **Pipeline timing is critical**: Signals must be sampled at correct stages (MRET/SRET bug)
2. **Decoder interface contracts matter**: RVC decoder must handle all inputs gracefully
3. **Incremental fixes work**: Each bug fix maintained test pass rate while adding functionality
4. **Debug methodology**: Cycle-by-cycle tracing + objdump comparison is highly effective

## Recommendations for Next Session

**Start with**: Simple RVC decoder unit test to verify basic decompression logic works

**Then**: Add PC trace from cycle 1-500 to see complete test execution flow

**Finally**: Compare actual execution against disassembly to find divergence point

**Tools to use**:
- `riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d` to see expected instruction sequence
- Cycle-by-cycle PC trace with instruction decode
- VCD waveform for detailed signal timing

**Expected time**: 2-3 hours to identify and fix remaining RVC bugs
