# Session Summary: C Extension Exception Logic Fix

**Date**: 2025-10-12
**Duration**: ~30 minutes
**Status**: âœ… Complete

## Summary

Fixed the misalignment exception bug in the C Extension implementation. The issue was a simple macro naming mismatch - the exception unit was checking for the wrong preprocessor macro name.

---

## Problem

The C Extension integration tests were triggering misalignment exceptions at valid 2-byte aligned addresses (e.g., PC=4), when they should only trigger at odd addresses (e.g., PC=1, PC=3).

**Symptom**: Exception triggered at PC=4 with C extension enabled
**Expected**: No exception - PC=4 is 2-byte aligned (valid for compressed instructions)

---

## Root Cause

In `rtl/core/exception_unit.v` lines 76-80, the code was checking:
```verilog
`ifdef CONFIG_RV32IMC
  wire if_inst_misaligned = if_valid && if_pc[0];  // Check bit [0] for C extension
`else
  wire if_inst_misaligned = if_valid && (if_pc[1:0] != 2'b00);  // Check bits [1:0]
`endif
```

**The problem**: The config system defines `ENABLE_C_EXT` as either 0 or 1 (not `CONFIG_RV32IMC`). When `-DCONFIG_RV32IMC` is passed to the compiler, it sets `ENABLE_C_EXT 1` in `rtl/config/rv_config.vh`. But since `ENABLE_C_EXT` is always defined (just with different values), an `ifdef ENABLE_C_EXT` would always be true regardless of the value.

---

## Solution

Changed the exception check to evaluate the **value** of `ENABLE_C_EXT` using a ternary operator:

```verilog
// exception_unit.v lines 76-77
wire if_inst_misaligned = `ENABLE_C_EXT ? (if_valid && if_pc[0]) :
                                           (if_valid && (if_pc[1:0] != 2'b00));
```

This correctly checks:
- **With C extension** (`ENABLE_C_EXT` = 1): Only bit [0] must be 0 (2-byte alignment)
- **Without C extension** (`ENABLE_C_EXT` = 0): Bits [1:0] must be 00 (4-byte alignment)

---

## Testing Results

### Before Fix
- Integration test: Triggered exception at PC=4
- Symptom: `exception=1` at valid 2-byte aligned addresses

### After Fix
- âœ… RVC decoder unit tests: 34/34 passing (100%)
- âœ… Integration test: No false exceptions, PC increments correctly (0â†’2â†’4â†’6â†’8â†’Aâ†’Câ†’E)
- âœ… RV32I compliance tests: 42/42 passing (100%)
- âœ… Verilator build: Clean (no lint errors)
- âœ… Icarus Verilog: Runs successfully

---

## Files Modified

1. **rtl/core/exception_unit.v** (lines 76-77)
   - Changed from `ifdef CONFIG_RV32IMC` to ternary operator with `ENABLE_C_EXT` value

---

## Verification

```bash
# Unit tests
iverilog -g2012 -Irtl -o sim_rvc_decoder tb/unit/tb_rvc_decoder.v rtl/core/rvc_decoder.v
vvp sim_rvc_decoder
# Result: 34/34 tests PASSED

# Integration test
iverilog -g2012 -DCONFIG_RV32IMC -Irtl -o sim_rvc_integration \
  tb/integration/tb_rvc_simple.v rtl/core/*.v rtl/memory/*.v
timeout 5 vvp sim_rvc_integration
# Result: No false exceptions, PC increments by 2 for compressed instructions

# Compliance tests
./tools/run_compliance_pipelined.sh
# Result: 42/42 tests PASSED (100%)
```

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Check macro definitions carefully**: Distinguish between checking if a macro is defined vs checking its value
2. **Ternary operators are cleaner**: For binary configuration choices, ternary operators are more explicit than `ifdef`
3. **Trust the simple explanation first**: Sometimes the bug really is just a wrong macro name!

---

## C Extension Status

The C Extension is now **COMPLETE** with all core functionality working:

- âœ… RVC decoder: 100% correct (34/34 instructions)
- âœ… Pipeline integration: IF stage decompression working
- âœ… PC logic: 2-byte increments for compressed instructions
- âœ… Exception handling: Alignment checks correct
- âœ… Both simulators working: Icarus Verilog + Verilator
- âœ… Backward compatibility: 100% RV32I compliance maintained

**Remaining work** (optional enhancements):
- Code density measurement (verify 25-30% reduction)
- Official RV32UC compliance suite tests
- Performance benchmarking

---

## Next Steps

With C Extension complete, next priorities are:

1. **Option A**: Complete CSR/Exception infrastructure (ECALL, EBREAK, MRET, trap handling)
2. **Option B**: Implement A Extension (Atomics) for RV32IMAC
3. **Option C**: Performance optimizations (branch prediction, caching)

**Recommendation**: Option A (CSR/Exceptions) - makes the processor truly functional for embedded systems.
