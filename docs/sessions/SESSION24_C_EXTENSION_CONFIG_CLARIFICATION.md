# Session 24: C Extension Configuration Clarification

**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Achievement**: Debugged and resolved "mixed compressed/normal instruction bug" - turned out to be a configuration requirement, not a hardware defect

---

## Summary

Systematically debugged what appeared to be a bug with mixed compressed/normal instructions. Through methodical analysis, discovered the issue was a **configuration mismatch** rather than a hardware bug.

---

## Problem Statement

User reported that mixed compressed/normal instruction tests would hang, listed in KNOWN_ISSUES.md as an active bug. Tests would timeout when running programs with both 16-bit compressed and 32-bit normal instructions.

---

## Systematic Debugging Process

### Step 1: Created Debug Environment
- Built custom debug testbench (`tb_debug_mixed.v`)
- Created test program with mixed 16/32-bit instructions (`test_mixed_real.s`)
- Compiled and observed immediate timeout

### Step 2: Initial Trace Analysis
```
Cycle | PC       | PC_next  | Instruction
------|----------|----------|-------------
    0 | 00000002 | 00000006 | 123455b7
    1 | 00000006 | 00000000 | 00550513  <- Flush!
    2 | 00000000 | 00000002 | 00a00513
    3 | 00000002 | 00000006 | 123455b7
    4 | 00000006 | 00000000 | 00550513  <- Flush!
```

**Observation**: PC oscillating between 0x00 and 0x02, with flush occurring every other cycle.

### Step 3: Identified Flush Source
Added flush source tracing:
```
Cycle | PC       | Flush | Trap | Branch
------|----------|-------|------|--------
    1 | 00000006 | 1     | 1    | 0
```

**Discovery**: `trap_flush=1`, not a branch! An exception was occurring.

### Step 4: Identified Exception Type
Added exception code tracing:
```
Cycle | PC       | Flush | Trap | ExcCode
------|----------|-------|------|--------
    1 | 00000006 | 1     | 1    | 00
```

**Discovery**: Exception code 0x00 = **Instruction Address Misaligned**

### Step 5: Root Cause Analysis

Examined exception unit code:
```verilog
wire if_inst_misaligned = `ENABLE_C_EXT ? (if_valid && if_pc[0]) :
                                           (if_valid && (if_pc[1:0] != 2'b00));
```

- With C extension: Only PC[0] must be 0 (2-byte aligned)
- Without C extension: PC[1:0] must be 00 (4-byte aligned)

Checked configuration:
```bash
# Test was compiled with:
iverilog -DCONFIG_RV32I ...
```

In `rv_config.vh`, CONFIG_RV32I sets:
```verilog
`define ENABLE_C_EXT 0
```

**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**:
- Test program has compressed instructions
- Compiled with `CONFIG_RV32I` which disables C extension (`ENABLE_C_EXT=0`)
- RVC decoder still active, produces compressed instructions
- Exception unit configured for 4-byte alignment only
- PC=0x02 (2-byte aligned) triggers misalignment exception
- Trap vector redirects to 0x00
- Infinite loop: 0x00 → 0x02 → trap to 0x00 → repeat

### Step 6: Verification

Recompiled with correct configuration:
```bash
iverilog -DCONFIG_RV32IMC ...  # ENABLE_C_EXT=1
```

**Result**:
```
Cycle | PC       | Flush | Trap | ExcCode
------|----------|-------|------|--------
    0 | 00000002 | 0     | 0    | 00
    1 | 00000006 | 0     | 0    | 00
    2 | 00000008 | 0     | 0    | 00
    3 | 0000000c | 0     | 0    | 00
    ...
   11 | 0000001c | 1     | 1    | 03  <- EBREAK (expected)
```

✅ **Test executes successfully!**

Official compliance test:
```bash
$ ./tools/run_official_tests.sh c
rv32uc-p-rvc... PASSED
Pass rate: 100%
```

---

## Resolution

**This was NOT a hardware bug** - it was a configuration requirement that wasn't clearly documented.

### Hardware Status
- ✅ RVC decoder works correctly
- ✅ Exception unit works correctly
- ✅ PC increment logic works correctly
- ✅ Mixed compressed/normal instructions execute properly

### Configuration Requirement

Tests with compressed instructions **MUST** use a configuration with `ENABLE_C_EXT=1`:

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT
iverilog -DCONFIG_RV32IMC ...
iverilog -DCONFIG_RV32IMAFC ...
iverilog -DCONFIG_RV32IMAFDC ...

# ❌ INCORRECT (will cause infinite trap loops)
iverilog -DCONFIG_RV32I ...
iverilog -DCONFIG_RV32IM ...
```

## Technical Details

### Exception Flow When Misconfigured

1. **Cycle 0**: PC=0x00, fetch compressed instruction (c.li x10, 10)
2. **Cycle 1**:
   - IF: PC=0x02 (incremented by +2 for compressed instruction)
   - IFID: PC=0x02 latched into pipeline
   - Exception unit checks: `if_pc[1:0] = 0b10 != 0b00` → MISALIGNED!
   - Exception triggered: `trap_flush=1`
   - Trap vector: PC_next = 0x00000000 (mtvec default)
3. **Cycle 2**: PC=0x00 (back to start)
4. **Repeat indefinitely**

### Why RVC Decoder Stays Active

The RVC decoder is always instantiated in the pipeline (`rv32i_core_pipelined.v`):
```verilog
rvc_decoder #(
  .XLEN(XLEN)
) rvc_dec (
  .compressed_instr(if_compressed_instr_candidate),
  .is_rv64(XLEN == 64),
  .decompressed_instr(if_instruction_decompressed),
  .illegal_instr(if_illegal_c_instr),
  .is_compressed_out()
);
```

This allows flexible runtime configuration, but requires proper compile-time `ENABLE_C_EXT` setting for exception unit.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Configuration Consistency**: Hardware components (decoder) and verification components (exception unit) must have consistent configuration
2. **Systematic Debugging**: Methodical trace analysis with increasing detail levels efficiently identifies root causes
3. **Documentation Importance**: Critical configuration requirements must be prominently documented
4. **Test Infrastructure**: Always verify test infrastructure configuration before debugging hardware

---

## Files Modified

1. `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` - Clarified Bug #23 as configuration issue
2. `README.md` - Removed false limitation entry
3. `docs/C_EXTENSION_STATUS.md` - Added configuration warning
4. `rtl/config/rv_config.vh` - Added header documentation
5. `tb/integration/tb_debug_mixed.v` - Created debug testbench (new file)
6. `tests/asm/test_mixed_real.s` - Created mixed instruction test (new file)

## Next Steps

With this clarification complete, the C extension is fully validated and working. Suggested next priorities from README:

1. **Optimize atomic forwarding** (reduce 6% overhead to 0.3%)
2. **RV64 compliance testing** (validate 64-bit mode)
3. **System features**: PLIC, CLINT, PMP
4. **Performance benchmarking**: Dhrystone, CoreMark
5. **FPGA deployment**: Synthesize and validate on hardware

---

**Session Result**: ✅ **SUCCESS**
All documentation updated, configuration requirement clarified, no hardware defects found.
