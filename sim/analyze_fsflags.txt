# HYPOTHESIS: The issue might be with fsflags accumulation or reading

## Test #7 flow:
1. Previous tests (#2-#6) have already executed
2. They've already set FFLAGS bits
3. Test #7 loads 1.1 into f10
4. Executes: fcvt.w.s a0, f10, rtz
5. Reads FFLAGS: fsflags a1, x0  <- This reads FFLAGS and clears it
6. Expects a1 = 0x01 (only NX from THIS operation)

## Potential bug:
- If FFLAGS accumulated from previous tests, a1 might have MORE than just 0x01
- The test expects ONLY the flags from test #7, not accumulated from all tests

## Need to check:
1. Does fsflags read the full accumulated FFLAGS?
2. Should each test start with clean FFLAGS?
3. Is there a FFLAGS clear between tests?
